<p>As a nonprofit tech organization, Code the Dream relies on software development volunteers to make our program a success. We are grateful to have dedicated volunteers who lead mentor sessions, assist with pair programming, review assignments, and much more. </p>



<p>But some volunteers go above and beyond. We are excited to celebrate their contributions through our Volunteer of the Month series. </p>



<p>Our Volunteer of the Month for July 2022 is Sarah Buckingham. Not only has Sarah participated as a mentor in two CTD classes, she has also encouraged other people to volunteer with CTD. Thank you, Sarah, for the impact you&#8217;ve had on the CTD community! </p>



<p>Sarah shared about his experience volunteering with Code the Dream. </p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>I have a 7-year old son, a 10-year old daughter and an 11-year old tri-pawed dog that keep me on my toes! I originally went to school for social work and saw the impact that tech had in the mental health space in terms of reaching vulnerable populations, creating ways for people to connect and giving people access to the tools they need to have agency in their own lives.&nbsp;So, I made the jump and attended a full-stack coding bootcamp about 4 years ago.&nbsp;I have worked for Crisis Text Line since we launched in 2013 and have been able to use both my clinical expertise and coding knowledge to help inform and build products that make our service more efficient and effective.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with CTD? </strong></p>



<p>I was so thrilled to hear about CTD — I personally remember the struggle and hardships of making a career change with two small children and a full-time job. I was excited at the opportunity to be able to give back, share my experiences and what helped me through the process to help students find the tools to help set them up to succeed.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring software developers? </strong></p>



<p>Trust the process! Imposter syndrome is real, but know that technology is always changing and software engineers are always learning – we are in this together.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">CTD students share their gratitude for Sarah</h2>



<p>Sarah has a dedicated group of students who regularly attend her mentor sessions. Several of them shared how much Sarah has helped them in their journey to become software developers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I truly appreciate Sarah and the amount of effort she puts into helping us. She begins each session with a poll to assess where students are and the proceeds to explain the week&#8217;s topic. She then checks in with students and addresses any issues they may have encountered while completing the assignment. She&#8217;s very mindful and knows how to break every subject down. She also always provided us with resources! I&#8217;m super grateful for her!</p><cite><strong>Kimberley B., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Sarah is so helpful and resourceful! Her mentor sessions were one of the first I attended and I immediately knew I wanted to keep attending hers. Sarah is extremely helpful and always follows up with you to make sure you understand the subject or still need help. I look forward to attending her sessions every week.</p><cite><strong>Diana C., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Sarah is one of the best mentors I have ever worked with. She always responds very quickly to messages, it is easy to arrange an online session with her, she is very patient and answers all my questions in a very detailed and accessible way. I am very grateful for her very valuable assistance!</p><cite><strong>Vadim D., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>Shane shared about their experience volunteering with Code the Dream.</p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>I started coding in college and quickly found that I enjoyed doing web and app development. After graduation, I found a position with <a href="http://www.onecowstanding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One Cow Standing</a> as a software developer doing just that. OCS is a software consulting company made up of great people and we’re cow-themed!</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>I feel like the clients we work with at OCS are doing meaningful work and I’m fortunate to be involved. However, I wanted to find ways to do more with regard to civic engagement and using my skills as a developer within that space. My co-worker, Jonathan, and I reached out to Code the Dream to see if there was any room for us to volunteer. We saw Code the Dream’s mission and values and said, “These people are doing important work and we want to try to help”.</p>



<p><strong>What has been meaningful about your experience with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>I’ve only been volunteering with Code the Dream for a short time, but I’m thankful for having the opportunity to meet and work with so many talented and friendly folks! It’s been really enjoyable to work directly with developers for pair-programming and on a smaller team focused on building out the offline-mode feature. I’m glad to be able to bring my experience to the table and share it with others.</p>



<h2>CTD apprentices share thanks for Shane and Jonathan </h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Shane and Jonathan have been a great addition in the Vamos App. They are a great asset in helping refactor and build our application stronger by contributing with pair programming, code reviews and further advice. I really appreciate them and would work with them again!</p><cite><strong>Dee Velasquez<br>Junior Developer, CTD </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Shane and Jonathan have both been wonderful to have on the Vamos team! They&#8217;re great team players that understand the importance and impact of Vamos. They have done great work by helping plan, organize, and build new features and improvements for Vamos. In addition, it has been great to see them share their knowledge with other developers across the Vamos team. I&#8217;m grateful for their time and dedication.</p><cite><strong>Andrea Hernandez Guzman<br>Senior Developer, CTD</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Jonathan and Shane have been a great help to the Vamos project and a pleasure to work with.&nbsp; Starting with pair programming, all the way through engaging design and development they have been a fantastic pair to collaborate with and I&#8217;m grateful they&#8217;ve decided to volunteer to work with us at Code the Dream.</p><cite><strong>Chuck Anderson<br>Developer and Mentor, CTD </strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>We spoke with Jamie about volunteering at Code the Dream. </p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>After enrolling in classes at five different universities, I finally obtained a four-year degree in Mathematics. During that (often frustrating) journey, I changed my major from Engineering Science to Music Performance and finally to Applied Mathematics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I obtained a job as a land surveyor for the North Carolina Department of Transportation surveying the infrastructure at railroad and highway crossings. From there, I drafted railroad crossings for a civil engineering firm before finally enrolling in a software bootcamp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I started freelancing before joining a dev team in a large consulting firm. Since leaving that company, I have been preparing to move to Mexico, where I plan on interviewing for work again. Last week, I obtained a Mexican visa which will allow me to remain there for four years. I love to travel and, to be honest, I am searching for my home.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with Code the Dream?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It is very personal for me. I have struggled with every step of my career. If it wasn’t with the raw skills, it was with the direction I was headed — &#8220;is this where I want to go?&#8221; &#8220;Is this what I want to do?&#8221; I am trying to be the person for others that I still need to guide me in this rewarding but very challenging life.</p>



<p><strong>What has been meaningful about your experience with Code the Dream?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Not coincidentally, my colleagues at Code the Dream have been extremely supportive and patient with everyone else involved in it. We’re all working towards a common goal of lifting everyone up; providing opportunities for others to succeed in life in a field that is difficult to break into. There is a lot to manage and coordinate. And a lot of room for miscommunication, finger pointing, missed deadlines. Yet none of those things occur. My colleagues are exceptionally professional and kind. Code the Dream seems to be a well-oiled machine. I do not take that for granted.</p>



<h2>CTD Students Share Thanks for Jamie</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Jamie is a fantastic teacher and one of the most patient people I know. He is always willing to sacrifice his time and help out whenever he can. He has helped me many times to understand complex JavaScript concepts that I thought I could never understand. My favorite thing about Jamie is that he always tries to check up on his students to ensure that we&#8217;re doing okay and not struggling with learning. We&#8217;re so lucky to have him!</p><cite><strong>Victoria T., Intro to Programming Student</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Jamie has been my go-to Mentor. Jamie &#8220;communicates&#8221; in a way that I can understand. He is also consistent. I appreciate his help in getting me this far into the program. Jamie rocks!!!”</p><cite><strong>Mackenzie S., Intro to Programming Student</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Jamie has been such an amazing help throughout my whole journey of coding. He helped me become comfortable with GitHub — if it wasn&#8217;t for him I&#8217;d still be trying to compare my branch to Code the Dream&#8217;s main branch!&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Kenneth D., React Student</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>“Jamie is excellent. He not only breaks everything down to where you understand the concepts, he also shows you how to actually research so that you can read and understand what you are reading from credible sources. His patience is unbelievable and I would not have understood some of the JavaScript fundamentals if it were not for Jamie.”&nbsp;</p><cite><strong>CasSundra S., Intro to Programming Student</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Jamie is always willing to help. He gives more than you ask. He takes the time to teach. Even if he is not around, he’ll circle back to make sure you got the help you needed. He’s a great asset to the CTD family!”</p><cite><strong>Tisha D., Intro to Programming Student</strong></cite></blockquote>
