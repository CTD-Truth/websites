<p>Code the Dream hosted a community Twitter Chat as part of our Tech &amp; Civic Engagement campaign. The series of questions and prompts led to an engaging conversation about the ways in which people use technology to connect with their local communities, their government, and the world around them.</p>



<p><strong>Here are a few of the highlights!</strong></p>



<h3>QUESTION #1</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To kick things off, we&#39;d like to learn more about you!<br><br>How old were you when you got your first computer? What about your first smartphone? What are your earliest memories of using these devices? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556717421251203072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Your ability to understand technology can vary based on when you were first introduced. For people who grew up with computers at a young age, often called digital natives, adapting to the Internet and new ways of communicating, learning, and doing business feels second-nature. Others may have taken longer to change their habits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I do remember when I was in high school (early 90s), my dad (who worked at a university) told my far-away sister look into this new thing called &quot;email&quot; that would enable you to send a letter and it would arrive *instantly*. I couldn&#39;t even conceive of what that meant!</p>&mdash; lori fernald khamala (@lorifk) <a href="https://twitter.com/lorifk/status/1556718509849206785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://codethedream.org/about/">Lori Khamala</a>, our director of programs, remembers hearing about the concept of “email” from her father, and how revolutionary it was at the time.</p>



<h3>QUESTION #2</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To follow-up: how well do you feel that you can navigate all the apps and tools those devices have to offer? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556718629684666368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>For the average person, the early days of the Internet were much simpler: write a document, make a spreadsheet, search for “dinosaurs” using Yahooligans on the school computer. Even then, adapting to life in the age of technology was not easy for everyone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It was early internet days, much simpler. I felt comfortable finding what I wanted but felt it wasn&#39;t accessibility friendly, lots of flashing lights, poor contrast, auto-playing animations/videos/sounds.</p>&mdash; Crystal Williams-Brown (@Crystal_WBrown) <a href="https://twitter.com/Crystal_WBrown/status/1556722868016357377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>In the modern world, digital literacy is crucial. Computers are quickly becoming the access point for education, news, jobs, health care, and many other aspects of everyday life. Accessibility has to be baked into our devices and systems so that any person can unlock the potential that modern technology provides.</p>



<h3>QUESTION #3</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Question #3: What are some ways that your relationship to technology has changed in the past 2 years? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556719989817843725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of us moved to work-from-home or hybrid office setups. This meant more households required quality internet access for work, school, and personal tasks like paying bills or doctor visits. Our options for entertainment and communing with friends also moved online, specifically to social media apps like TikTok and YouTube.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While having these options gave us an outlet during quarantine, it expedited an already dangerous trend of addiction to our devices and screens, a habit that many of us are still trying to kick.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s definitely complicated. I feel like technology &amp; screens just became more inevitable for me and society as a whole- like I *really* can&#39;t escape!</p>&mdash; lori fernald khamala (@lorifk) <a href="https://twitter.com/lorifk/status/1556722149230092288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Governments had to adapt, too. Services and means of communication that were typically in-person now relied heavily on digital platforms, and counted on citizens to have access to these platforms.</p>



<h3>QUESTION #4</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Question #4: How would your life change if you didn’t have regular access to the Internet? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556721804739313668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Even in 2022, access to quality Internet or a computer isn’t a given. “According to the US Census Bureau, nearly 20% of North Carolina households do not have access to a meaningful device. For 4.4% of NC households, a smartphone is the only “computer” that they own. 14.4% of households don’t have a device at all,” according to the <a href="https://www.ncbroadband.gov/">NC Department of Information Technology website</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PreTech is now the stone age. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to function properly without it as so much is dependent on it. I would have to resort to using a paper, pen, and a library card for everything without internet.</p>&mdash; Hanh Nguyen (@techhanh) <a href="https://twitter.com/techhanh/status/1556722914455482368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The NC DIT works to close the digital divide through initiatives that solve the issues of affordability, access to technology and digital literacy in the modern world.</p>



<p>Some municipalities, like Wilson, NC and Chattanooga, TN, have taken steps to create their own high-speed broadband networks to better serve communities in areas where affordable, quality internet isn’t available through the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/875548059/why-wilson-n-c-became-its-own-internet-provider">Wilson</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/1996234/the-best-broadband-in-the-us-is-in-chattanooga-tn/">Chattanooga</a> community-owned services.</p>



<h3>QUESTION #5</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Question #5: Where do you get most of your news? Take the poll and share more about your news consumption with us in the thread. What social media do you use to look for news? How often do you check the news? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556724437361299456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As news media moves more and more online, access and digital literacy, two topics we mentioned earlier, are important to building an informed community.</p>



<p>In an episode of the “Far Flung” podcast, host <a href="https://twitter.com/kidethnic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Saleem Reshamwala</strong></a> explores how journalists in Caracas use creative ways to present the news and keep the community informed in a country without a free press or regular access to the internet. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Caracas’s magic bus" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1INihpfq9PRnbS1V8gvW9P?si=5009da71bf014ec4&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>
