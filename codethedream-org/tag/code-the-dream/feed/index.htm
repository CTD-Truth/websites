<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a> (CTD) is happy to announce that Daisy Magnus-Aryitey, co-founder and former board member, has returned to Code the Dream as the first Director of Partnerships.</p>



<p>A native of Ghana, Magnus-Aryitey moved to the US when she was four and came to North Carolina in 2009. She enrolled in an early version of Code the Dream and within a year was working as a full-time software developer at Duke University.</p>

<p></p>



<p>After completing the Code the Dream prototype program, Daisy worked with co-founders Dan Rearick and Ramiro Rodriguez to build Code the Dream into its current incarnation, serving as Director of Programs and Board Vice-Chair. In her new role as Director of Partnerships, Magnus-Aryitey will be responsible for creating and cultivating business partnerships that will expand CTD&#8217;s volunteer and mentorship network, website and app projects for Code the Dream&#8217;s in-house software development shop, <a href="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Copy-of-CTD-v2-new-pics-Trifold-Brochure-8.pdf">CTD Labs</a>, and employment opportunities for CTD apprentices.</p>



<p>“CTD’s mission and values resonate with me on a personal level, particularly their continued commitment to racial and economic justice,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “In my new role, I’ll be focused on creating partnerships with tech companies in the Triangle and across the country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey’s life experience — and her experience with every facet of CTD — make her uniquely qualified for her new position.</p>



<p>“Daisy has always been at the heart of Code the Dream,” said Executive Director Rearick. “While it&#8217;s been great having her on the board, we are thrilled to have her back in our day-to-day leadership — building a more diverse, inclusive economy and technology for a better world.”</p>



<p>Fostering partnerships is particularly important as Code the Dream continues a period of rapid growth — CTD has more than tripled its scope over the last two years, from its start as a grassroots organization serving people in North Carolina to serving students and communities in 12 states, from a permanent staff of 4 to a staff of 17, with 34 full time software apprentices. The 39 apps and websites built by CTD Labs now serve more than two million people.</p>



<p>“Code the Dream is uniquely positioned to support efforts around developing diversity in tech as well as building software that serves the greater good,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “I’m thrilled to be back in this community!”</p>



<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream </a>is a Durham-based national nonprofit opening career opportunities in tech for people from underrepresented backgrounds, including immigrants &amp; refugees, women, and people of color and from low-income communities. CTD Labs builds socially impactful apps and web technologies.&nbsp;</p>
