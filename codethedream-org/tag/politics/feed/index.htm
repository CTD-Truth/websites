<h2><em>How is technology used to create more engagement between citizens, their communities, and their government?</em></h2>



<p>For centuries, advancements in technology have changed the way we interact with other people and the world around us. Communication tools, from the printing press, to the telephone, to social media, have made it easier to create and disseminate information. Modes of transportation like jet planes, high-speed rail, and automobiles make it faster to visit any place on the planet. But these tools, as remarkable as they are, have a cost. The industrial revolution has expedited the effects of climate change. Social media tools like Facebook and Twitter have allowed propaganda to spread faster and more plentiful than ever before, raising tensions and splintering communities.</p>



<p>At Code the Dream, we believe technology has the power to build a better, brighter future for everyone. But with great power comes great responsibility. How can we leverage these great technological innovations to strengthen our communities through civic engagement?</p>



<p>Over the next two months, weâ€™ll be talking to authors, politicians, scientists, and our own <a href="https://codethedream.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CTD staff</a> and <a href="https://codethedream.org/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apprentices</a> about the ways tech can serve as a vehicle for connecting communities and improving lives. Stay plugged into our website and social media for video interviews, blog posts, live chats, and more. We hope you will join the conversation!</p>
