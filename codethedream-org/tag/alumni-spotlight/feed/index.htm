<p>Quay Weston is a CTD alumni from the 2019 React cohort. He credits his time in the program with “giving me the tools and the language to talk to developers which helped me move into UI/UX design and connected me with other dope people in the tech space.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Community has been the most important part of my professional journey because a lot of the opportunities that I ended up getting I knew nothing about prior to talking to others or someone saying ‘you have these particular skills, I think you’d be great for this.’ That’s been every step of my professional experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Quay shared his story last month during the inaugural Alumni Reunion at American Underground, where students, apprentices, mentors and staff gathered to celebrate the amazing, diverse group of people that make up the Code the Dream community. Diversity is a founding pillar of Code the Dream and the work we do. When asked about it, Quay had this to share:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Diversity in tech looks like folks with different experiences, different backgrounds, various levels of education, people with cognitive differences. The reason why it’s important to me is because for actual change to happen, the kind of transformative change we need in the world, you have to have others with far more imagination and ambition.</p></blockquote>
