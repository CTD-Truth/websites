<p>Sintu moved to the United States with her family five years ago and didn’t have any real IT experience at that time. After volunteering in Atlanta, Georgia, she joined Code the Dream as a student before eventually becoming a front-end developer. Being new to coding, Sintu really appreciates how helpful has everyone been throughout this process: ‘’Code the Dream means collaborations and teamwork. All of the people here are very welcoming and helpful.  Working on different projects, you learn about the diversity and people’s backgrounds. I like that because so many different people can join.’’ She really enjoys working on real life projects because that’s something she didn’t get to experience before CTD: ‘’After I joined Code the Dream, it was real environment and real projects and I just knew that I wanted to be a software developer because I enjoyed working on real projects.’’ One of her favorite things about the organization is its diversity. Every day, she gets to work with diverse backgrounds: ‘’CTD is a place where everyone is accepted without any limitations. You get to work with many people and there is a lot of diversity. It is the right place for everyone no matter their background and without exclusions. I love this experience and I would recommend it to everyone.‘‘</p>

<p>Selamawit is originally from Ethiopia and she moved to the U.S. in 2018 after winning the diversity visa lottery. She has a background in civil engineering, but she also got the chance to learn coding during her bachelor’s study. After working as a cashier for over a year and receiving her Master’s degree in software development, she joined CTD in October 2020 for an internship. Her favorite thing about Code the Dream is the family atmosphere: ‘’For me, Code the Dream is family. We help each other, we share our experiences, since most of the people are from different countries. It feels like I’m somewhere with my family and friends. Everyone supports us whenever we need help or just have a question during coding. I love working with these people and I’m never scared to ask questions because everyone is so friendly. I just really like it.’’ Selamawit has always enjoyed volunteering and working with people with different backgrounds and Code the Dream gives her an opportunity to do that: ‘‘The people working here are from different countries, which creates multicultural environment and diversity of culture. I like that environment.’’</p>

<p>Martina and her husband moved to the U.S. from Serbia in 2018 to create a better future for their family. Having an experience in web design, Martina was looking for a job and an opportunity to grow as a developer. She found out about Code the Dream through UpwardlyGlobal, an organization that helps immigrants land their first job in a field they have their degree in. She decided to join, and is really happy about her decision: ‘‘This experience is unforgettable. From the first moment, I had a strong feeling that I was in the right place because of the people, who were guiding us through the program, the quality of the program itself, mentors, who are incredibly patient and supportive and really knowledgeable and because of really cool and friendly classmates.’’ She is currently developing her back-end skills while working on the VAMOS project with other developers. Martina’s favorite thing about CTD is its’s mission: ‘‘I like Code the Dream’s mission of helping underprivileged people to make their dream come true to become software developers by educating them, supporting them and giving them a chance to implement their knowledge in participating at the development of amazing apps and helping people in need. I like the opportunity they are giving people and that they are doing real projects that are actually helping people, while also helping other non-profit organizations.’’</p>
