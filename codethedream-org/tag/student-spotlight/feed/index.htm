<p><strong>Name</strong>: Kassidy Holtzman</p>



<p><strong>Where are you from?</strong> Norlina, North Carolina</p>



<p><strong>What class are you in?</strong> Koi (Ruby on Rails)</p>



<p><strong>How did you find out about Code the Dream? What made you want to join?</strong> My last year of college at Vance-Granville Community College my teacher Ms. Gill recommended that I sign up for the class.</p>



<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to be a software developer?</strong> I loved my first Ruby on Rails class and wanted to keep taking more even while I was studying Simulation and Game Development in school.</p>



<p><strong>What kinds of work were you doing before Code the Dream?</strong> I was a college student.</p>



<p><strong>What has your experience been like at Code the Dream?</strong> Everyone at Code the Dream doesn’t treat it like another “job.” They are super nice and super helpful. I would recommend Code the Dream to any family member or friend.</p>



<p><strong>What do you like about Code the Dream?</strong> I like that Code the Dream is remote. It makes it easier for me, especially now. Also, my questions are answered in a timely manner when I run into issues.</p>



<p><strong>If you could build any app, what would it do?</strong> I’m actually working on an app now for my final project that lets people become a student at Hogwarts from Harry Potter.</p>

<p>After finding out about Code the Dream through an email from her community college, Paola decided to take one of our classes last October. She knew she wanted to have some kind of an education, but she also had a hard time finding the right direction for her career: ‘‘Nothing was really sticking with me and that is why I tried Code the Dream, to try something different.’’ CTD turned out to be the right choice for her, as she finally realized that programming is what she really enjoys doing: ‘‘My experience at Code the Dream has been amazing. I feel like I’m more passionate now and more secure in knowing that this is what I want to do and I think Code the Dream really helped with that. There’s so many different people doing different things and applying code differently. Peer reviewing has been really helpful and that’s not something I have never had access to before.’’</p>



<p>She admits that peer learning and reviewing is something that made a big impact on her in terms of retaining information. Both her peers and our mentors were the main reasons she enjoyed her time at Code the Dream: ‘‘I love all the mentors, everyone is super helpful. We have everyone at our fingertips, you can send a direct message to anybody you need to reach out to and ask specific questions. The mentors are very also available, we have different mentor sessions to choose from. I have enjoyed the whole process and I have loved getting to know different people, especially my peers. We struggle together and that keeps me motivated because I’m not alone at having a hard time.’’</p>

<p>Sinan blazed through CTD classes, becoming a full-stack developer in record time! He started as an apprentice in CTD Labs in December, which marks his first real experience building apps. Even though he had a high technical ability, his lack of experience in the U.S. prevented him from landing a position in tech. ‘’Before CTD I was kind of frustrated. I was looking for a position, but I didn’t have any experience. Code the Dream changed that. During the class, I was working on projects and gained a lot of knowledge. It gives me the confidence to know that I now have experience in tech. I think that is the best thing I gained from Code the Dream.’’ He specifically enjoyed the structure of the class and interacting with our mentors: ‘’I really liked the design of the class. It was very flexible and gave me a chance to create my own timeline. I also really liked the mentors. I have tried other programs, but there the time was very limited due to the amount of students. At Code the Dream, some of the mentor sessions were even on weekends, which gave us more time with them.’’</p>

<p>Congratulations to Jorge Gabitto, who finished our first full-stack class in January, and who started as an apprentice in CTD Labs last month. After being involved in education, Jorge was looking for an opportunity to learn about coding, while also being able to make an impact: ‘’I have always felt like I wanted to do something meaningful, but I was not exactly sure how. I also didn’t know how I was going to afford to do that and Code the Dream helped me figure that out.’’ While taking the class, Jorge really enjoyed interacting with our mentors and his fellow classmates and he really appreciates the opportunity to do all of it for free: ‘’I want to thank the donors and whoever donates and contributes to Code the Dream. I think their contributions allow people like myself, who didn’t really have a clear path forward in terms of career, to pursue that. It creates opportunities for people who may not have had enough opportunities. The money they donate really makes a difference in people’s lives.’’ While Jorge doesn’t have a clear idea about his career path yet, he is determined to create a positive change. For people like him, CTD is a great place to start: ‘’I think programs like Code the Dream are important because some people don’t have a lot of opportunities and Code the Dream provides that. It creates opportunities but also changes the way you think. CTD’s purpose is to help people through technology and just being involved with that makes you think differently. It changes how you are.’’</p>

<p>Congratulations to Grant Young, who just completed our Intro to Programming “Catarina” class, a class specifically targeting rural North Carolinians! He decided to try coding after job changes due to COVID-19. “I was very unsure about where I wanted to go, but Code the Dream gave me a solid path to walk on.” Grant appreciated the opportunity to participate in a free program for people living in remote areas. “Code the Dream feels like a community of people who are willing to be there and work with you. I want to say thank you to the mentors and the creators and founders of the organization. I wouldn’t know what to do when it comes to coding if it wasn’t for some form of structure.” Grant will be continuing with CTD’s Ruby on Rails class, starting at the end of the month.</p>
