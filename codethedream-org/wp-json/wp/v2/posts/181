After taking the course and remaining linked to the program for more than two years, she is now the outreach coordinator. &#8220;What we do is web applications, that is, Internet pages.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cynthia R\u00edos, daughter of Peruvian parents, is 16 years old and a student at Garner High School and has been the youngest student to take classes. &#8220;I&#8217;m here a year and a half ago. I feel very happy to have the opportunity to create because you can be what you want. &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>R\u00edos works together with Rub\u00e9n Cruz, 23, on a website for Kidznotes, a music education program for minorities. &#8220;I finished regular classes at Durham Tech to enter university because I want to study programming.

After taking the classes, Osorto began working with Jorge Rodr\u00edguez on the Internet page: conectatecarolina.org, which helps farm workers find resources in their areas.<\/p>\n<p>Those interested in participating should go to the website: www.codethedream.org\/classes Calls are opened four times a year and two courses are given in Raleigh and two in Durham. After entering their information they are called for an interview. The basic course lasts from 7 to 12 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>About the requirements, the essential thing is to &#8220;want to learn&#8221; to like science and math, to be between 15 and 25 years old (although they are working on opening the program for adults of that age soon) and to know English.<\/p>\n<p>Classes are free and it does not matter the student&#8217;s nationality, place of residence or immigration status.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally published on August 30 in La Noticia . by Paola Jaramillo&nbsp; A free program offered by a nonprofit organization that has become a bridge for dozens of young immigrants to integrate into the world of Internet page programming. &#8220;The goal of &#8216;Code the Dream&#8217; is to give immigrants the opportunity to open spaces in<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[1,4],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>La Noticia Newspaper: Free programing classes offered for immigrant youth - Code the Dream<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/2017-8-26-la-noticia-newspaper-free-programing-classes-offered-for-immigrant-youth\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"La Noticia Newspaper: Free programing classes offered for immigrant youth - Code the Dream\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Originally published on August 30 in La Noticia . by Paola Jaramillo&nbsp; A free program offered by a nonprofit organization that has become a bridge for dozens of young immigrants to integrate into the world of Internet page programming. &#8220;The goal of &#8216;Code the Dream&#8217; is to give immigrants the opportunity to open spaces in\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/2017-8-26-la-noticia-newspaper-free-programing-classes-offered-for-immigrant-youth\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Code the Dream\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CodeTheDream\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2017-08-27T00:27:00+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2019-01-24T15:26:26+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Screen%20Shot%202017-11-28%20at%204.53.35%20PM.png.35%20PM.png\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@CodeTheDream\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@CodeTheDream\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"Alejandra Rodriguez\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"2 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Code The Dream\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/code_the_dream\/\",\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/code-the-dream\/\",\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCVZD7NzRcXYHOL9owisMr4g\/channels\",\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CodeTheDream\/\",\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CodeTheDream\"],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/#\/schema\/logo\/image\/\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/CTD_Logo_Primary.png\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/CTD_Logo_Primary.png\",\"width\":2077,\"height\":438,\"caption\":\"Code The Dream\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/#\/schema\/logo\/image\/\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/\",\"name\":\"Code the Dream\",\"description\":\"Real Talent.
