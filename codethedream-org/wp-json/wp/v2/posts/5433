We wrote about this class back in the fall \u2013&nbsp;it&#8217;s our first remote-only class and has students from across the United States. I caught up with two of our students, Danielle Madry and Daniela Monti, and asked them about their experience so far. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Danielle Madry<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tell me about yourself!<\/em> I am from Kinston, North Carolina. I am a 29-year-old stay-at-home mom who loves to learn, spend time with my tribe, and create projects with my new-found programming skills. I am a Renaissance woman \u2013 I know a little about everything. It usually works in my favor, but sometimes it leaves work unfinished. But it is still a part of me that I embrace fully. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What are you most proud of during the Ruby on Rails course so far?<\/em> Staying consistent and not giving up when life and learning got tough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think makes Code the Dream unique?<\/em> Code The Dream provides a secure and solid future into tech through learning not only for me, but for generations of other learners that are in need.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What podcasts have you been listening to recently?<\/em> I have been loving Code Newbies and Breaking into Startups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Who is your hero?<\/em> My mother is my hero because I have seen her go through so much and never give up. She always finds a way to make it work. She would literally have nothing and somehow, someway find a way to make sure we were good. I aspire to resilient like her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Daniela Monti<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tell me about yourself!<\/em> I am from&nbsp;Long Island,&nbsp;NY. I currently work at a non-profit that supports adults with disabilities. It was not something I ever expected to be doing, but I have grown a lot in the five years that I have been here. In my free time, I enjoy reading, doing photography, hand lettering, working out, and being outside (especially at the beach!).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think makes Code the Dream unique?<\/em> I love that Code the Dream is FREE, but still offers guidance and a curriculum. It would have been very difficult for me to spend the time and money going back to school, so I wanted to learn to program in a less traditional manner. There&nbsp;are plenty of \u201cfree\u201d ways to learn programming without schooling, but then you don\u2019t necessarily have the accountability or guidance, which I knew I would need. I also love that we work in small groups with a mentor who works in the industry. I am not only learning how to code, but I am also so making professional connections which I hope will make finding a job in the future much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What food is overrated?<\/em> Bacon is overrated. And why is it in EVERYTHING?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What&#8217;s something that surprises people about you?<\/em> People are definitely surprised to learn I went to a professional wrestling school for three years (and it was how I met my boyfriend!). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Who is your hero?<\/em> It may be a bit clich\u00e9 to say that my parents are my heroes, but now that I am older I don\u2019t know how they did all that they did for my siblings and me while we were growing up. Especially as a new homeowner, I can\u2019t fathom how my mom found the time and energy to do all that she did (home-cooked meals <em>every<\/em>&nbsp;night!). My Dad has also been a volunteer firefighter for the past 30+ years. &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our Ruby on Rails students are back at work learning CSS and HTML in the second phase of their class, which focuses on web basics.
