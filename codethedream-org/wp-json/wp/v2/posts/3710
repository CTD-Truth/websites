My family is of Puerto Rican descent.<\/li>\n<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far?<\/em> Code the Dream has treated me better than I could have expected up to this point. I\u2019m in tune with CTD&#8217;s mission and goal. I believe prioritizing the people is what makes CTD a unique organization to produce talent in this fast-growing industry.<\/li>\n<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? <\/em>At this time, I\u2019m working on my portfolio and we started a second project in which my partner and I are collaborating ideas for a music app. We shall see how it turns out.<\/li>\n<li><em>What is your dream job? <\/em>What I want is to make something out of myself, but to achieve that, I believe I need to surround myself with people in this group and people or are better than me so I can pick up talent. If you really want to know a \u201cdream job\u201d then it would be to reach out to people who are less fortunate than me. How do I accomplish that? Only time would tell.<\/li>\n<li><em>What music have you been listening to recently? <\/em>I\u2019ve listened repeatedly to \u201cWelcome to this Party\u201d by Dave East feat. King Shooter. I\u2019m a huge fan of sub-genre gangsta rap. It gives me hype.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Lennda Chen<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3717 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1-238x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"159\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1-238x300.jpg 238w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1-768x968.jpg 768w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1-812x1024.jpg 812w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/20190920_100629-1-600x756.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tell me about yourself.<\/em> I was born in North Carolina and then taken to China as a baby for 4 years before then coming back to the US. My parents settled in Virginia for a while, so I stayed there for 4 years. From there my family moved to North Carolina because we had bought a new restaurant. We moved to Durham because my family said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big city.&#8221; Indeed, it was \u2013 and is \u2013\u00a0 a very booming city.<\/li>\n<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far?<\/em>\u00a0 My experience at Code the Dream has been great. CTD has been my first full-time job and my official first step into an IT career. The environment at CTD as an intern is very nurturing and community-oriented. It has taught me a great deal about what the professional world can be, instead of as cutthroat as I have read. There aren&#8217;t many programs like CTD. It teaches every immigrant, stay at home mom, or person interested in tech that their dreams are possible.<\/li>\n<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? <\/em>Since starting at Code the Dream we have been working on several projects, including a tic-tac-toe board, a calculator, a profile page, and several more. These projects will allow me to be able to show future employers an example of my ability in react.js. I have been astounded by how far I have come. As a small-town immigrant child, I thought my only options were going into tons of debt in order to break into a career as a doctor or lawyer after years of studying, but now I&#8217;m taking my first steps into the IT world at 20, which would not be possible without CTD. This has been all very adventurous and shows how much can be accomplished in so little time.<\/li>\n<li><em>What is your dream job? <\/em>My dream job used to be a pharmacist or a makeup creator who creates the makeup or a social worker, but seeing how much I can do in code has definitely swayed me a little towards the tech field.<\/li>\n<li><em>Now for a hot-button issue. Does pineapple belong on pizza? <\/em>ALWAYS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Mary Alice Moore<a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-3715 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429-600x800.jpg 600w, https:\/\/codethedream.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_4429.jpg 1401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Tell me about yourself.\u00a0 <\/em>I grew up in Northern Virginia but moved to the Raleigh area over ten years ago.\u00a0 My hobbies include playing with my ferrets, crafting, and graphic design.<\/li>\n<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far? <\/em>My experience at CTD so far has been amazing!\u00a0 Learning skills in a classroom could never teach as they are at the forefront of what the industry is currently doing.
