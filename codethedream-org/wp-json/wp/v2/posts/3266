The app&#8217;s drivers are volunteers who sign up to donate their time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So, essentially the volunteer will sign up (and then) put in their availability, just like they would in a Google calendar,&#8221; Olesen said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The families then request a ride by submitting a time and place they would like to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helena Harris said she plans to use the &#8220;Ride Together&#8221; app in order to get a ride to work. She currently relies on the city&#8217;s public bus system, which can take hours to transport passengers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If the bus is late, the first thing you do is say you are going to be late,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;The first thing they say is, &#8216;How late?'&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the Ride Together app, Harris can request a ride at a specific time, which means she may be able to find a better job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I could go further for work (and) be more available for work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That would let me have more money.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Families Together is looking for additional volunteers who are willing to provide transportation to those in need.
