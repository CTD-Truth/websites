Just to have access to the space. Access to the resources, the instructors and getting your foot in the door,&#8221; student Manuel Ramos Gonzalez said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are then able to get jobs in technology and coding, industries with increasingly high demands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe best part is watching students progress and remembering where they were just a few months ago,\u201d Executive Director Dan Rearick said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crystal Williams-Brown was working in a grocery store before she learned about Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She always had an interest in technology but didn&#8217;t think she could pursue a career in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would love if it could inspire someone who has brushed it off and said that&#8217;s not for me if someone would just see and hear me and just give it a shot,&#8221; Williams-Brown said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code the Dream classes, for high school students and young adults, are available year-round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now with our classes they come in and say oh I am not the only immigrant. I am not the only person of color I am not the only one in this environment,\u201d Magnus-Aryitey said. \u201cThat is what makes code the dream so special.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Code the Dream opens doors, launches careers By Mandy Mitchell, WRAL reporter &amp; Hannah Webster, WRAL.com editor DURHAM, N.C.&nbsp;\u2014 A Durham startup is making dreams come true for adults and high school students who want to work in technology.
