<p>Justin Laidlaw, <a href="https://codethedream.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engagement Manager at Code the Dream</a>, talks with Sonja Ebron, co-founder at <a href="https://courtroom5.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtroom5</a>, about how their technology is simplifying the legal process for the average person and making it more affordable. This conversation is part of our <em><strong>Tech &amp; Civic Engagement</strong></em> series.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>What is Courtroom5?</h2>



<p>Courtroom5 is a do-it-yourself technology that empowers users to get the training, tools and support they need to win tough legal cases.</p>



<p>Neither of the company’s founders, Debra Slone and Sonja Ebron, have a background in practicing law. Slone has a Ph.D in library science, Ebron a Ph.D in electrical engineering. But through their own struggles as two Black women dealing with the complexities and enormous cost of the American legal system, the two set out to solve a problem that millions of others face around the country.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><a href="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/https___s3.amazonaws.com_appforest_uf_f1649735734808x273213025855637800_Sonja-Debra-BFE.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/https___s3.amazonaws.com_appforest_uf_f1649735734808x273213025855637800_Sonja-Debra-BFE.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9679" width="750" height="484" srcset="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/https___s3.amazonaws.com_appforest_uf_f1649735734808x273213025855637800_Sonja-Debra-BFE.jpeg 750w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/https___s3.amazonaws.com_appforest_uf_f1649735734808x273213025855637800_Sonja-Debra-BFE-300x194.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><figcaption>Sonja Ebron (left) and Debra Slone (right), co-founders of Courtroom5.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“There are 7 million people handling debt collection, foreclosure, even personal injury claims, and dozens of other cases on their own because they can’t afford a $5,000 retainer or $300 an hour to pay a lawyer to represent them,” said Ebron.“</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>This is not just unjust, it’s undemocratic.</strong> This is not a high-end retail store where you can’t afford to make a purchase. This is our government. In particular, this is the branch of our government that’s set aside specifically to hear disputes like these… The process is so difficult and so technical that the average person just can’t navigate it on their own. We are essentially losing what is our First Amendment right to petition our government.</p></blockquote>



<h2>How does Courtroom5 work?</h2>



<p>Courtroom5 allows users to input information about their case: things like what court they’re in, what type of claim is being made, and who the parties involved are. With the use of artificial intelligence, Courtroom5 tracks your progress and sends relevant information as well as training tools so that you can prepare important documents required for court proceedings.</p>



<p>“We simply walk you at every step of the case through making a good decision on what to file at any particular step, and making that filing as effective and persuasive as you can be with a judge in order to get to the next step,” said Ebron.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Courtroom5 is only providing information. Decision-making is still up to the user. Every state has its own statutes in place that prohibit the unauthorized practice of law.</p>



<p>“For legal reasons, we can’t tell you, and we may not know, explicitly what you should do. We wouldn’t want to give legal advice as a machine,” said Ebron.</p>



<p>Although Courtroom5 is available nationwide, they still have to adhere to the rules of any state where a case is located, preventing them from making decisions on behalf of a user, but some states are starting to re-evaluate those rules.</p>



<p>“There are a couple of states that are really relaxing those sorts of rules, and a number of states are looking at it because there’s such a problem with accessing justice,” said Ebron</p>



<p>The court system was not immune to the trouble caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and had to adjust to operating virtually while many areas of the country were shut down.</p>



<p>“We saw during the pandemic that while the physical courthouses had to close, they had a constitutional obligation to remain open in some way and so we saw much more access to electronic filings in the court made available to people without lawyers. Lawyers have been able to do that for a while but now regular people around the country are more able to do it,” said Ebron.</p>



<h2>What is this technology important?</h2>



<p>Access to information is a significant barrier for many marginalized groups. As we become more reliant on the Internet and technology for everyday activities like work, school, and healthcare, people need to know where to find the resources they need to make important decisions about their lives, including engaging with the government. She believes our public library systems, a subject in which her co-founder Debra is already an expert, could be a model for how to deploy this useful information.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Every municipality in the country has a public library. In order to be a librarian, you need a Master’s degree. You have to demonstrate a capability of finding information and making it accessible for average people… But the vast majority of the information that patrons need is in city government or county government. Why can’t we deploy that tremendous talent that we put in public libraries to help people access the information in their own government?</p></blockquote>



<p>Through their technology, Courtroom5 has assisted thousands of people in making the right choice for themselves as they prepare for their day in court. Ebron continues to be a tech-optimist, especially as it relates to helping people in marginalized communities, but says that building the right technology is only half the battle.</p>



<p>“There are loads of opportunities for technology to make a difference but frankly we have to have the people who would adopt that technology, bring it into our institution, and be willing to implement it.”</p>

<p>Volunteers at Code the Dream wear a lot of hats – class mentors, assignment reviewers, project coaches in CTD Labs, and Skill-IT series leaders, to name a few. Our program is possible because of their dedication.</p>



<p>Our volunteer of the month for August 2022, Roy Mosby, a volunteer who has gone beyond the typical involvement of volunteers. Roy, who currently works as a software developer for Arcweb Technologies, is a mentor in our summer 2022 React class and plans to mentor again in our fall React course. Roy has also become involved in our class planning team, giving valuable feedback on our class processes and creating a plan for issue reporting in CTD assignments. </p>



<p>Roy recently shared about their volunteer experience with Code the Dream. </p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>I am a military retiree with 16 years in Army communications. For the final three years I managed my command&#8217;s intranet portals. Only a portion of that time was spent customizing web pages, but it was enough to entrance me with the potential of web technologies. I took up a similar position as a military contractor after retiring. My time there solidified my resolve to pursue web development as a second career.<br>When my family was financially stable enough, I quit my job and signed up for a full-stack bootcamp. After six month&#8217;s full-time learning then time on the job hunt, I landed my dream job! I&#8217;m currently a software developer with Arcweb Technologies and could not be more thrilled.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>Aside from military, coding is the most challenging thing that I have taken on. I would not have succeeded without a lot of help and support along the way. My wife and son believed in me. I have had several outstanding mentors and patient teachers that have been there to answer my many questions. I was lucky to have a support system and room to grow into a new career. Even though the hours that I put in were long and often frustrating, I owe my success to others. I want to pay that forward.</p>



<p><strong>What has been meaningful about your experience with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s so satisfying to witness students have that &#8220;AHA!&#8221; moment when things clicked. In the short several months here, I&#8217;ve seen this happen more than once. Volunteer mentors have plenty of leeway to focus on points that we find important during our mentor sessions. The staff are also very receptive to feedback about the curriculum. Ultimately, I am delighted that I can use my experience to elevate others so that they can pursue their dreams.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Several of Roy&#8217;s students thanked him for his work at Code the Dream. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Roy is awesome. He explains things so you can understand and he is very knowledgable. I love his problem-solving skills and how he paints a picture of being a real-life developer, including the issues you may run into and how to solve them. </p><cite><strong>George O., React student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I know that I can ask Roy questions without hesitation because he is very friendly and has a calm personality. </p><cite><strong>Nuriye A., React student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Roy has been an essential part of our most recent class improvements that help ensure students completely new to the field will be prepared to succeed in our programs.</p><cite><strong>Mary Alice Moore, CTD Class Coordinator</strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>Code the Dream hosted a community Twitter Chat as part of our Tech &amp; Civic Engagement campaign. The series of questions and prompts led to an engaging conversation about the ways in which people use technology to connect with their local communities, their government, and the world around them.</p>



<p><strong>Here are a few of the highlights!</strong></p>



<h3>QUESTION #1</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To kick things off, we&#39;d like to learn more about you!<br><br>How old were you when you got your first computer? What about your first smartphone? What are your earliest memories of using these devices? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTDxTCE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CTDxTCE</a></p>&mdash; Code The Dream (@CodeTheDream) <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTheDream/status/1556717421251203072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Your ability to understand technology can vary based on when you were first introduced. For people who grew up with computers at a young age, often called digital natives, adapting to the Internet and new ways of communicating, learning, and doing business feels second-nature. Others may have taken longer to change their habits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I do remember when I was in high school (early 90s), my dad (who worked at a university) told my far-away sister look into this new thing called &quot;email&quot; that would enable you to send a letter and it would arrive *instantly*. I couldn&#39;t even conceive of what that meant!</p>&mdash; lori fernald khamala (@lorifk) <a href="https://twitter.com/lorifk/status/1556718509849206785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://codethedream.org/about/">Lori Khamala</a>, our director of programs, remembers hearing about the concept of “email” from her father, and how revolutionary it was at the time.</p>

<p>For the average person, the early days of the Internet were much simpler: write a document, make a spreadsheet, search for “dinosaurs” using Yahooligans on the school computer. Even then, adapting to life in the age of technology was not easy for everyone.</p>

<p>In the modern world, digital literacy is crucial. Computers are quickly becoming the access point for education, news, jobs, health care, and many other aspects of everyday life. Accessibility has to be baked into our devices and systems so that any person can unlock the potential that modern technology provides.</p>

<p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of us moved to work-from-home or hybrid office setups. This meant more households required quality internet access for work, school, and personal tasks like paying bills or doctor visits. Our options for entertainment and communing with friends also moved online, specifically to social media apps like TikTok and YouTube.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While having these options gave us an outlet during quarantine, it expedited an already dangerous trend of addiction to our devices and screens, a habit that many of us are still trying to kick.</p>

<p>Governments had to adapt, too. Services and means of communication that were typically in-person now relied heavily on digital platforms, and counted on citizens to have access to these platforms.</p>

<p>Even in 2022, access to quality Internet or a computer isn’t a given. “According to the US Census Bureau, nearly 20% of North Carolina households do not have access to a meaningful device. For 4.4% of NC households, a smartphone is the only “computer” that they own. 14.4% of households don’t have a device at all,” according to the <a href="https://www.ncbroadband.gov/">NC Department of Information Technology website</a>.</p>

<p>The NC DIT works to close the digital divide through initiatives that solve the issues of affordability, access to technology and digital literacy in the modern world.</p>



<p>Some municipalities, like Wilson, NC and Chattanooga, TN, have taken steps to create their own high-speed broadband networks to better serve communities in areas where affordable, quality internet isn’t available through the private sector.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>How is technology used to create more engagement between citizens, their communities, and their government?</em></h2>



<p>For centuries, advancements in technology have changed the way we interact with other people and the world around us. Communication tools, from the printing press, to the telephone, to social media, have made it easier to create and disseminate information. Modes of transportation like jet planes, high-speed rail, and automobiles make it faster to visit any place on the planet. But these tools, as remarkable as they are, have a cost. The industrial revolution has expedited the effects of climate change. Social media tools like Facebook and Twitter have allowed propaganda to spread faster and more plentiful than ever before, raising tensions and splintering communities.</p>



<p>At Code the Dream, we believe technology has the power to build a better, brighter future for everyone. But with great power comes great responsibility. How can we leverage these great technological innovations to strengthen our communities through civic engagement?</p>



<p>Over the next two months, we’ll be talking to authors, politicians, scientists, and our own <a href="https://codethedream.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CTD staff</a> and <a href="https://codethedream.org/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apprentices</a> about the ways tech can serve as a vehicle for connecting communities and improving lives. Stay plugged into our website and social media for video interviews, blog posts, live chats, and more. We hope you will join the conversation!</p>

<p>Last week, a collection of staff, apprentices, alumni and students came together for an in-person coworking session at <a href="https://frontier.rtp.org/">The Frontier in Research Triangle Park</a>.</p>



<p>Our program went virtual during the pandemic like many folks around the country. We’ve adapted to building a strong online community but we still miss seeing our friends and colleagues in person. Coworking Day provided an opportunity to deepen our relationships with people in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. <a href="https://codethedream.org/about/">Lori Fernald Khamala</a>, Director of Programs at Code the Dream, emphasized the importance of face-to-face interaction.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One of my favorite parts was looking over to the next table to see CTD staff, apprentices, and students all talking and connecting. We all felt so grateful for the opportunity to meet together IN PERSON! We try hard to form a sense of community over Zoom, but seeing people build instant rapport and connections while physically sitting next to each other was an important reminder to me that some things really are just better in person.</p><cite>Lori Fernald Khamala</cite></blockquote>

<p>As a nonprofit tech organization, Code the Dream relies on software development volunteers to make our program a success. We are grateful to have dedicated volunteers who lead mentor sessions, assist with pair programming, review assignments, and much more. </p>



<p>But some volunteers go above and beyond. We are excited to celebrate their contributions through our Volunteer of the Month series. </p>



<p>Our Volunteer of the Month for July 2022 is Sarah Buckingham. Not only has Sarah participated as a mentor in two CTD classes, she has also encouraged other people to volunteer with CTD. Thank you, Sarah, for the impact you&#8217;ve had on the CTD community! </p>



<p>Sarah shared about his experience volunteering with Code the Dream. </p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>I have a 7-year old son, a 10-year old daughter and an 11-year old tri-pawed dog that keep me on my toes! I originally went to school for social work and saw the impact that tech had in the mental health space in terms of reaching vulnerable populations, creating ways for people to connect and giving people access to the tools they need to have agency in their own lives.&nbsp;So, I made the jump and attended a full-stack coding bootcamp about 4 years ago.&nbsp;I have worked for Crisis Text Line since we launched in 2013 and have been able to use both my clinical expertise and coding knowledge to help inform and build products that make our service more efficient and effective.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with CTD? </strong></p>



<p>I was so thrilled to hear about CTD — I personally remember the struggle and hardships of making a career change with two small children and a full-time job. I was excited at the opportunity to be able to give back, share my experiences and what helped me through the process to help students find the tools to help set them up to succeed.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring software developers? </strong></p>



<p>Trust the process! Imposter syndrome is real, but know that technology is always changing and software engineers are always learning – we are in this together.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">CTD students share their gratitude for Sarah</h2>



<p>Sarah has a dedicated group of students who regularly attend her mentor sessions. Several of them shared how much Sarah has helped them in their journey to become software developers. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I truly appreciate Sarah and the amount of effort she puts into helping us. She begins each session with a poll to assess where students are and the proceeds to explain the week&#8217;s topic. She then checks in with students and addresses any issues they may have encountered while completing the assignment. She&#8217;s very mindful and knows how to break every subject down. She also always provided us with resources! I&#8217;m super grateful for her!</p><cite><strong>Kimberley B., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Sarah is so helpful and resourceful! Her mentor sessions were one of the first I attended and I immediately knew I wanted to keep attending hers. Sarah is extremely helpful and always follows up with you to make sure you understand the subject or still need help. I look forward to attending her sessions every week.</p><cite><strong>Diana C., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Sarah is one of the best mentors I have ever worked with. She always responds very quickly to messages, it is easy to arrange an online session with her, she is very patient and answers all my questions in a very detailed and accessible way. I am very grateful for her very valuable assistance!</p><cite><strong>Vadim D., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>Code the Dream student Suheyla Cetin started a new job as a software engineer with New York-based startup Array this summer, achieving a goal she has been working toward for two years.</p>



<p>Cetin enrolled in Code the Dream in 2021 after relocating to the US from Turkey in 2015. She completed her master’s degree in Religious Studies in 2018, and worked as a spiritual caregiver before deciding to change career paths.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always loved math and science, so I wanted to try out software development,” Cetin says.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>She started with an Udemy full stack course, loved it, and started researching groups that could help her continue to learn. After studying alone, Cetin found Code the Dream to be a welcome change.</p>



<p>“You have your friends doing the same classwork and mentors helping you, a community of learners supporting each other,” she says. “I am still in touch with my classmates and mentors.”</p>



<p>Code the Dream’s flexibility also aided Cetin’s studies.</p>



<p>“It really worked for me because I have a busy life with two little kids,” she says. “Code the Dream was flexible, and I could study when they were sleeping, and I would wake up early. Code the Dream is great for parents and working people.”</p>



<p>Cetin says she plans to continue her studies with Code the Dream, and stay involved with the organization going forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Code the Dream, we rely on dedicated volunteers to help us accomplish our mission of changing the face of the tech industry. We are especially thrilled when one of our graduates gives back by volunteering with our classes or projects. That is the story of our volunteer of the month, Shanna Murry, who finished a class with Code the Dream and is now helping other people achieve their dreams of becoming software developers. </p>



<p>Shanna first came to Code the Dream in March 2021 for one of our Ruby on Rails classes. Now, she works as a Software Engineer for Lob, a company based in San Francisco. </p>



<p>Shanna told us how much Code the Dream meant to her career development: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I was unemployed and struggling financially just a year and a half ago. I was referred to Code the Dream by a mentor and decided to take the Ruby on Rails class. &nbsp;I had looked at boot camps and they were all so expensive, it was out of my reach at the time. &nbsp;I thought is was so great that there was a program like Code the Dream available for free, and with a focus on helping open doors for underrepresented groups in tech. &nbsp;I love that Code the Dream takes things beyond just coding, they really help students access all the tools they need to be successful like financial literacy and interviewing workshops, for example. &nbsp;I really feel proud to be a part of this program.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now that she is a software developer, Shanna is giving back by mentoring in CTD&#8217;s classes. She is currently mentoring in her third CTD class. Several of her students shared how valuable she has been as a mentor: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Shanna is an incredible mentor! She patiently helped me to understand concepts that I will use throughout my career. She is great at problem-solving, and she has a kindness and sense of humor that makes her fun to work with. She explains things in a way that helps me remember what she is describing. I really appreciate the many times she helped me throughout Intro to Programming — I couldn’t have done it without her!</p><cite><strong>Brittany H., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Shanna&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great&nbsp;mentor.&nbsp;She&#8217;s&nbsp;there&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;her,&nbsp;and&nbsp;no&nbsp;matter&nbsp;what&nbsp;you&#8217;ll&nbsp;always&nbsp;leave&nbsp;her&nbsp;sessions&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;more&nbsp;tricks.&nbsp;She&#8217;s&nbsp;kind&nbsp;and&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;see&nbsp;that&nbsp;she&nbsp;enjoys&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;others.&nbsp;I&nbsp;know&nbsp;that&nbsp;whoever&nbsp;consults&nbsp;her&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem,&nbsp;she&#8217;ll&nbsp;try&nbsp;her&nbsp;best&nbsp;to&nbsp;help&nbsp;them&nbsp;understand&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;solve&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem;&nbsp;I&nbsp;know&nbsp;programming&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;for&nbsp;me,&nbsp;but&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;attended&nbsp;her&nbsp;sessions&nbsp;I&nbsp;left&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;every&nbsp;subject.</p><cite><strong>Cecilia R., Intro to Programming Student </strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>We are so thankful for Shanna&#8217;s involvement in the CTD community! </p>

<p>Shane shared about their experience volunteering with Code the Dream.</p>



<p><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. </strong></p>



<p>I started coding in college and quickly found that I enjoyed doing web and app development. After graduation, I found a position with <a href="http://www.onecowstanding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One Cow Standing</a> as a software developer doing just that. OCS is a software consulting company made up of great people and we’re cow-themed!</p>



<p><strong>Why did you get involved with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>I feel like the clients we work with at OCS are doing meaningful work and I’m fortunate to be involved. However, I wanted to find ways to do more with regard to civic engagement and using my skills as a developer within that space. My co-worker, Jonathan, and I reached out to Code the Dream to see if there was any room for us to volunteer. We saw Code the Dream’s mission and values and said, “These people are doing important work and we want to try to help”.</p>



<p><strong>What has been meaningful about your experience with Code the Dream? </strong></p>



<p>I’ve only been volunteering with Code the Dream for a short time, but I’m thankful for having the opportunity to meet and work with so many talented and friendly folks! It’s been really enjoyable to work directly with developers for pair-programming and on a smaller team focused on building out the offline-mode feature. I’m glad to be able to bring my experience to the table and share it with others.</p>



<h2>CTD apprentices share thanks for Shane and Jonathan </h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Shane and Jonathan have been a great addition in the Vamos App. They are a great asset in helping refactor and build our application stronger by contributing with pair programming, code reviews and further advice. I really appreciate them and would work with them again!</p><cite><strong>Dee Velasquez<br>Junior Developer, CTD </strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Shane and Jonathan have both been wonderful to have on the Vamos team! They&#8217;re great team players that understand the importance and impact of Vamos. They have done great work by helping plan, organize, and build new features and improvements for Vamos. In addition, it has been great to see them share their knowledge with other developers across the Vamos team. I&#8217;m grateful for their time and dedication.</p><cite><strong>Andrea Hernandez Guzman<br>Senior Developer, CTD</strong></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:300"><p>Jonathan and Shane have been a great help to the Vamos project and a pleasure to work with.&nbsp; Starting with pair programming, all the way through engaging design and development they have been a fantastic pair to collaborate with and I&#8217;m grateful they&#8217;ve decided to volunteer to work with us at Code the Dream.</p><cite><strong>Chuck Anderson<br>Developer and Mentor, CTD </strong></cite></blockquote>

<p>To celebrate Asian-American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we would like to highlight the work of <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/team">Reshma Saujani</a>. Saujani is of Gujarati Indian descent. She founded <a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a> in 2012 after learning about the vast gender disparities in computer science education while running for Congress. Saujani wrote a book entitled <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Not-Perfect-Fear-Bolder/dp/1524762334">Brave, Not Perfect</a></em>, and launched a <a href="https://www.bravenotperfect.com/podcast/">companion podcast</a> of the same name in 2018 featuring guests like Congresswoman AOC and singer/songwriter Lizzo.</p>



<p>Saujani continues to make a mark on the tech industry, advocating for women&#8217;s rights in the workplace and beyond. As fellow advocates for change in the tech industry, we admire the progress Saujani and her team have made to open doors and elevate the voices of the underserved.</p>
