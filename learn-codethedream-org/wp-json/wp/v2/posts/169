As the instructor does each step, be sure you pause the video and do the same step to your version of the application.  You should test as you go along, to make sure what you have done is working.  The instructor will show several different ways to do things.  The best approach is not to erase, but to comment out the first methods the instructor shows before inserting the subsequent approaches, so that you can remember each way to do things.
