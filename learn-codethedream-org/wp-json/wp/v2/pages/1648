Luckily, JavaScript has a couple of data types that are used for just that. An Array is simply an ordered collection of items (Strings, numbers, or other things).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/js\/js_arrays.asp\" target=\"_blank\">This tutorial<\/a>\u00a0is a great introduction.<\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/js\/js_array_methods.asp\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a>\u00a0covers some of the most useful built-in array methods.

None of us know what tomorrow may bring. The interesting thing about that fear is that it can be positive or negative. If you&#8217;ve been excited about the prospect of starting a new job, starting a new relationship, or venturing to a new place, you&#8217;re experiencing the positive side. If you&#8217;re worried about something in the future that may be an unpleasant experience like having to confront someone about a problem or ending a personal or professional relationship, you&#8217;re experiencing the negative side. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be feeling this way in this class; excited to learn new things and start a new chapter in your life, frustrated if you struggle with a concept, happy when you understand and succeed, worried about how to juggle class with the rest of what is going on in your life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your fear of the unknown is positive or negative, embracing the unknown allows you to continue on your journey and see where it goes.
