That will take you to a github classroom and create a git repository for you.  You clone this repository to your workstation to begin working on your assignment.  One of the assignments recommends that you clone with a URL that starts with git (ssh) but I recommend that you use https.  You would do this assignment after completing the JavaScript Basics, Numbers, and Functions class videos described above.  Note to Windows users: To do this assignment, you must have node.js installed.  You can either install it under windows, or use the one already installed in your Vagrant environment.  You do not need to complete this lesson this week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assignment for Week of 6\/22<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To accept this assignment, click on <a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/BIt8r38X\">this link<\/a>.  That will take you again to the github classrom.  You would do this assignment after completing the JavaScript courses up through JavaScript and the DOM.  You do not need to complete the lesson this week. Hint for Question 3: calculate_sphere should do the computations, put the results in the corresponding fields, and then return false.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assignment for Week of 6\/29<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Complete the previous assignments, and go through the Treehouse classes on DOM Scripting by Example and the two Git classes.  We will divide up into teams and get ready for our two development projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Midnight Train Git Workflow<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These projects are not open source, and therefore we will not use forks.  Instead we will use feature branches and two protected branches, those being master and development.
