Feel free to review that topic and your answers this week (<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/how-the-web-works\/\">link to that week&#8217;s lesson here<\/a>). We&#8217;ll be talking about asking for help again, but this time let&#8217;s focus on the <em>when <\/em>since we&#8217;ve already covered the <em>how<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of this course you may have wanted to ask for help as soon as you hit a problem and before you even tried to debug or problem solve on your own. You don&#8217;t have to do that anymore since you have those problem solving and debugging processes we&#8217;ve been talking about. But the opposite can happen too; sometimes you get so determined to solve the problem on your own that you spend hours longer than you needed to trying to fix something, when asking for help could have saved you time and frustration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read this article about <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/04\/how-to-ask-for-help-at-work\">knowing when to ask for help at work<\/a><\/strong>, then answer the following questions:<br>&#8211; Have you implemented\/used any new strategies since the previous post on how to ask for help?
