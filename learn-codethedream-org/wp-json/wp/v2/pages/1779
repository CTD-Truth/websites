Two aspects of design are visual hierarchy and color theory.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visual hierarchy is how we decide where to place pieces of our site so they\u2019ll be easy to find, interact with, or stand out.  Visual hierarchy goes a long way in whether or not the user has an easy and pleasant experience navigating their environment, or a challenging and frustrating time. <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/xd.adobe.com\/ideas\/process\/information-architecture\/visual-hierarchy-principles-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\">This article from Adobe<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0is a lengthy one, but covers basically all the variables to take into account when creating a layout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for color theory, <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.webspec.com\/2017\/03\/the-importance-of-color-in-web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\">this article from WebSpecDesign<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0gives a good introduction to beginners about color theory and usage on the web. In almost any resource about color theory on the web you\u2019ll notice references to accessibility. We\u2019ll dig more deeply into that topic next week, but to get a preview, read just the\u00a0<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/intro\/#people\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cIntroduction\u201d and \u201cPeople with Disabilities on the Web\u201d sections of the WebAIM page<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0and be thinking about how your design choices may effect those individuals with different abilities from yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design is more than just colors, fonts, and layouts.  Always try and keep your user and\/or client in mind.  Have you ever been somewhere (in person or on the web) that was new to you and you needed a minute to find your way around? If it was a physical location, how did you find the exits\/bathrooms\/stairs? If it was a website, were you able to find the page that had the information you wanted easily, like the product description page?  Just like whether or not there are clear bathroom signs, your design choices can make for a great or uncomfortable experience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please answer the below prompts in your assignment submission:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Think about a time when a layout personally impacted your experience (like the examples in the first paragraph) and describe the scene for us. Also share how you felt when you could\/couldn\u2019t find what you were looking for.<\/li><li>In the visual hierarchy article, were there topics that surprised you? If so, which one(s) and why?<\/li><li>What are some of your most favorite and least favorite design features as a user?<\/li><li>What was something new you learned about colors\/color theory and how do you think that knowledge will effect your design choices?<\/li><li>Try out some different background\/foreground color combinations using <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/color.a11y.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">this tool from A11y<\/a><\/strong>.
