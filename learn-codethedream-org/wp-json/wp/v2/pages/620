Keep your old repository from week 2. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Create a new branch off master\/main called &#8216;week-4-site-update&#8217; or something similar (this is similar to the concept of a feature branch) so:\u00a0<br><code>git checkout -b week-4-assignment<\/code>\u00a0<br>This allows you to keep your old work on master\/main while you do your new assignment. Once you have all of the work that you want added on your new branch you can&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Merge your new branch back into master. <br>This can be done in a variety of ways.\u00a0\u00a0 One way is to commit your changes on new branch, which you should be doing anyway:\u00a0\u00a0<br><code>git add  <\/code>\u00a0<br><code>git commit -m 'describe your changes at a high level in message'.<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Then, checkout your main branch\u00a0<br><code>git checkout master <\/code><br>then merge\u00a0<br><code>git merge week-4-assignment<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. From there you&#8217;d want to push your master branch back to your remote repository on github and it would be updated both locally and remotely. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely you can do a pull request once your changes are done &#8211; this is how you would work in a team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve committed your changes and are done with your week-4-assignment branch, you put your work on the remote by doing:<br><code>git push origin week-4-assignment <\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, inside of github you would make a Pull Request where master\/main is the base branch an your week-4-assignment is the &#8220;compare&#8221; branch and merge them that way. Then you&#8217;d re pull your master\/main branch after that was merged online and your local would be updated that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s it for this week!
