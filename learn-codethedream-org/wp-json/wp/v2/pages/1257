If you did work with a mentor to figure out that bug, you likely observed them put a few debugging practices into action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debugging is the process of working through technical challenges when something is broken or not working as expected, and it is a HUGE part of most developer\u2019s day-to-day. Ideally, we would write beautiful, perfect code the first time around and introduce no bugs\u2026 but we\u2019re human after all, so that\u2019s not the reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given, we humans do (often) introduce bugs into our programs, it\u2019s important to invest time into strengthening your<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rithmschool.com\/blog\/debugging-like-a-scientist\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;<\/a>debugging processes.&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rithmschool.com\/blog\/debugging-like-a-scientist\" target=\"_blank\">Read this article<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;about some common and helpful debugging practices.
