Then do bundle install.  Occasionally you will need to do yarn install &#8211;check-files to update the resources managed by yarn.  Occasionally you will need to do bundle update to update the resources managed by the bundler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this assignment, maintain your repository to reflect all changes that the instructor shows in the video, in a git branch called blog. It is important that you continue to make changes as the instructor directs, because otherwise you won&#8217;t remember the skills.  You will continue to work with the same git repository in Lesson 3.2.  One Rails 6 note: The instructor uses render text: which is now obsolete.  You need to do render plain: instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mindset curriculum assignment can be found <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/mindset-curriculum-debugging-part-1\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"1488\">here<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to Ruby on Rails Backend Class Lesson 6.
