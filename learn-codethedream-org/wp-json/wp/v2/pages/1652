The age old myth of the lone coder sitting in the dark coding through the night has finally been upended in recent years. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading tech industry companies now create open, collaborative workspaces and harness tools that enable software developers to work together more effectively\u2014if not on code directly then at least on knowledge sharing or getting projects over the finish line. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially given your cohort mates in Code the Dream are working toward similar goals, there&#8217;s no time like the present to start putting peer-to-peer collaboration into practice. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2020\/04\/collaborative-coding-ultimate-career-hack\/\"><strong>This article<\/strong><\/a> shares some more formal methods of collaboration common in the software development space (including pair programming, code reviewing, and agile), but feel free to start with some lighter weight collaboration practices first, like asking a peer to hop on a screenshare to walk through code with you when you get stuck\u2014and offering to do the same for them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; How is collaboration used in your own family\/culture\/current workplace\/etc. ?<br>&#8211; What\u2019s one challenge you, personally, encounter while collaborating with others? What ideas do you have for overcoming that challenge?<br>&#8211; What&#8217;s one topic you want to start collaborating with classmates on this week?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Coding Assignment, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, submit ALL of your assignments (coding and mindset) using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Other Material<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a video that you may want to preview this week.  From next week on in the class you&#8217;ll be building actual files that you will then push a copy (and any changes you make to those files) to your GitHub account repository.  A common program a lot of our students and professionals use is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/code.visualstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Visual Studio Code<\/strong><\/a>.  This program allows you to write your code, arrange your file structures, and even has helpful built-in features and optional extensions to make code writing a simpler process.  This video is on your lesson page for next week too so you can refer to it easily there as well.  As always, bring any questions you have to your mentor sessions so you can get answers and learn more about your lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/R8lusLkuWJQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link to open video in a new window<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Visual Studio Code with Shawn Clary\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R8lusLkuWJQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Objectives Object Basics Loop Through Objects Lesson Materials Go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page.
