You\u2019re going to be learning a couple of big new things in this tutorial that will be super useful for your final group project. Don\u2019t worry, they are all super easy to get started with! Most importantly, Firebase, which we will be using to prototype our backend and handle user authentication. Second, this tutorial will give you a quick intro into NextJS, a really powerful tool for building server-side rendering React apps that is quickly gaining ground as a go-to choice for building React applications.<ul><li><strong>Important note one<\/strong>: You will want to run &lt;npm install firebase@8.2.3&gt; instead of just &lt;npm install firebase&gt;. Firebase &gt;9 has a breaking change that would require some refactoring to make work.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Important note two: <\/strong>Create a .env.local file and add it to your .gitignore. It should look like this, but with the values that you get from the Firebase console when you create your new \u201cFirebase web app\u201d&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/czaFhrZUwwbjCM9YvxsQOH7deCcMXef39sSHMw7KPOml-FtI_mHfn1mH4L96Zl69mQtuuaX3BwaKzWqnXTz3-dxdSMAuadsbpXf9utKbBVR0X5Dt0OYFYaCaYtWHe6f-S0m0zLXd\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your config should look like this instead of what is in the book. <strong><em><mark class=\"kt-highlight\">You 100% do not want to commit any code to GitHub with your API keys exposed!<\/mark><\/em><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/y8mArTI7WgaElUEum1h36_uI8dpjcusv7Z47u0T4WMI3gNVfaIaqrKW0PWe7g_-XIJl0jy2EntWBiVx1oaiZ0PRbDUtUYT9vRaMlc4reouA1JV4ub_qKaqlCrUkZzk_XY-jXLEGF\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now, add .env.local to your .gitignore file so it is not committed <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/AFBPZVdPExzgyqpfLMh7ejXX1xW9H_ebV9aFZ13ZdKmYTFvBP9tnRk88E9-5GEK4be_sorouIag7z5zOoNFsnU-YI2DIjWAS-5Var_8VvVSfA8kLZPsdx-B5d6X5heTUe7en6rd4\" width=\"624\" height=\"603\"><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>After you have each gone through the tutorial individually, your group can choose which repository you want to move forward with. If you are significantly more comfortable with create-react-app, you could pretty easily abstract the Firebase-config away and use the rest of the Firebase code with a create-react-app, but we really like the simplicity of this tutorial as an intro to Firebase and the Firestore database.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/CodeTheDream\/nextJS-firebase-starter\">Here <\/a>is a working repository for NextJS based on the tutorial you can use as a starting point.&nbsp;<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/CodeTheDream\/firebase-react-cra\">Here<\/a> is a working copy to the same app but done via create-react-app<\/li><li><strong>Conclusion and Next Steps: <\/strong>So, now you have an app that is reading from and posting to Firebase and handling registration and authentication, but it has a long way to go. How would you go about restricting blog posts to specific users? (<strong>hint: <\/strong>You probably also want to create a user collection in your db in addition to having them saving in the authentication table in firebase)&nbsp; How do you edit and delete items from a collection? Understanding data structures and all of the different ways we can structure data flow of an app is also super important for front-end developers, and this is a great opportunity to get your feet wet and fight through a lot of really important items.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other probable next steps:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Header, a footer, and potentially a layout component to wrap around your pages.&nbsp;<\/li><li>A CSS framework, Material UI (mui), Chakra, semantic-ui-react, and react-bootstrap are all good options and are allowed in this project.  You are not required to write all of your CSS from scratch.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"resources\"><strong>Resources<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating your App and Getting Started with Firebase + NextJS<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Docs: <a href=\"https:\/\/firebase.google.com\/docs\/reference\/js\/firestore_\">Firebase docs<\/a><\/li><li>Tutorial: <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@steven_creates\/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-use-google-firestore-with-react-93769994fe6c\">Another React Firebase firestore tutorial&nbsp;<\/a><\/li><li>Repo: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/CodeTheDream\/nextJS-firebase-starter\">Starter Repo based on Next Firebase Repo<\/a><\/li><li>Docs: <a href=\"https:\/\/firebase.google.com\/docs\/database\/web\/structure-data\">Firebase data structure guide<\/a><\/li><li>Article: <a href=\"https:\/\/highlyscalable.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/01\/nosql-data-modeling-techniques\/\">Advanced Data Structure Guide<\/a><\/li><li>Docs: <a href=\"https:\/\/nextjs.org\/docs\/getting-started\">NextJS documentation<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>General Project Setup and Teamwork<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Article: <a href=\"https:\/\/guides.github.com\/features\/wikis\/\">Documenting Your Projects on GitHub<\/a> (GitHub Guides)<\/li><li>Article: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/resources\/blog\/how-to-start-a-group-project\/\">How to Start a Group Project<\/a> (Codecademy)<\/li><li>Video: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OdQtww8ZfEw&amp;ab_channel=Codecademy\">Working with Code Written by Someone Else<\/a> (Codecademy)<\/li><li>Video: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=scEDHsr3APg&amp;ab_channel=Fireship\">DevOps CI\/CD Explained in 100 Seconds<\/a> (Fireship)<ul><li>Brief explanation of why you should work in tiny bites and integrate your code into the project very often (continuous integration).<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>List: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/dam\/jcr:e7e22f25-bba2-4ef1-a197-53f46b6df4a5\/SWTM-2088_Atlassian-Git-Cheatsheet.pdf\">Git Commands Cheat Sheet<\/a> (Atlassian)<\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project Definition &amp; Setup Get your project and yourself set up for success on your team Activities As a Team At your first weekly meeting, you should cover the following project details.
