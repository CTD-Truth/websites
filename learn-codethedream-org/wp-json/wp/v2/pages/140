The back end is the engine that serves up the web pages, responds to the web APIs, and communicates with the database. There are a variety of frameworks for back end development, but in this class series we will use the Rails framework, which relies on the Ruby language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back End 1 focuses on the basics of SQL, Ruby, and simplified web hosting using Sinatra. It is necessary preparation for Back End 2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Skills to be learned include SQL database communication, hosting web pages, responding to get, post, update, and delete requests, and customizing dynamic web pages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assignments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the following assignments, you will have a starter git repository, with a README.md that gives detailed instructions for the assignment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/3sC7kKB7\">Week 1 <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/4kf9rycU\">Week 2<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/WlbZFhum\">Week 3 <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/1sTYBNNR\">Week 4<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/xBiLD-xV\">Week 5<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/0lVozHUC\">Week 6<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><br><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to Back End I, the first class in our Back End development track.
