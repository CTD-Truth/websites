You should also create a free Zoom account to access mentor sessions. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Attendance &amp; Deadlines<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plan to complete each week&#8217;s Treehouse content and assignment by the end of the week. Once you get behind, it&#8217;s hard to catch back up. If you feel like you&#8217;re in danger of falling behind, reach out to a mentor or someone at CTD for help! <\/li><li>Code the Dream does not penalize students for turning in an assignment late, but we do have set deadlines at the end of each unit. <strong>All students must complete assignments by the dates listed on the <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/current-classes\/\">course pages<\/a>. If you have not completed the assignments by that date, you will be assumed to have dropped the class. <\/strong><\/li><li>If an unexpected life occurrence makes it impossible for you to keep up with the course material, let us know. We want to work with you to make sure you\u2019re on-track. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Mentor Sessions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor sessions are scheduled throughout the week and are a place for students to learn more about the week&#8217;s content, get help on code, and connect with each other. <\/li><li><strong>Plan on attending two mentor sessions per week. <\/strong>Use the mentor group sign-up forms to RSVP for a session. If you want to attend more than two mentor sessions, feel free to attend as many as you need!<\/li><li>Make sure you are able to share your screen to talk over questions about code. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Completing Assignments <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Each week you will complete an assignment through GitHub classrooms to demonstrate your knowledge of the concepts covered in Treehouse.<\/li><li><strong>Comment your code when completing assignments. <\/strong>This will help you make sure you and others understand your process and can help you organize and simplify your code. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/commenting-your-code\/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out this mini-lesson<\/a> for instructions on best practices for commenting your code.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Asking for Help and Assignment Feedback<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We&#8217;ve created a Slack bot that you can use to ask for help and request feedback on your assignments. It&#8217;s called <strong>Ask Squibby.<\/strong> Search for &#8220;Ask Squibby&#8221; in the Slack search bar and fill out the form, and one of us will get back to you as soon as possible. <\/li><li>We&#8217;re working to respond to assignment feedback as quickly as possible, but we think this is a learning opportunity.<strong> Being a good developer is not necessarily about a grade or getting every challenge right<\/strong>, it&#8217;s about learning concepts and training yourself how to solve problems with code. Even more, it&#8217;s about progress. Are the things you struggled with last week a little bit easier this week? And if they are not easier, how can you find the place you are stuck and get help through it?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Class Expectations Technical Requirements We expect, at minimum, that all students have access to a computer and stable internet access.
