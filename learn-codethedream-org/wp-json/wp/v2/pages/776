Rails screen when you connect your browser to the root path of your application. Right after the Rails.application.routes.draw line of your routes.rb, put the line<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>root to: 'customers#index'\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This will configure the server to bring up this page when you connect to the root path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try the Application Out<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Start the rails server. Then, in the browser, go to your \/ URL path.&nbsp; Try it out: You will see that you can create customer records, edit them, show them, and delete them. Leave a few customer records in.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; However in our, now try this URL path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>\/customers\/567<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see the error screen that follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/4nVvF7knp435ht-jSKPRE5ieH5JagugkSYRD0XntnmGyWZ1VxO3yue8x90NqH2W29Et_4r1Pvp2kLg8ZIia1IenJ-MK4WrhApLcmP7-48PJYJxNAGdZuF7VCd3W_XW-2OX-lZCo0wbo\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So we try byebug, as described below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Byebug<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the error message, the problem occurs in line 67 of app\/controllers\/customers_controller.rb.&nbsp; So, with our editor, we add a line that says just:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>byebug<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>right before the failing line in that file (right after def set_customer).&nbsp; Then we re-run the server, and go to the \/customers\/567 url to duplicate the error.&nbsp; The browser will appear to hang waiting on the server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to your command line session where you are running the server console.&nbsp; You will see something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"601px;\" height=\"182px;\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/ooOl1R4qpQGP1y-eY1_eOjFPL0aOtoiWiKvOgbrUxnPzzk0AWYTGZcgT1YXgX3ZO-waWK6SrNqJOKBA8KlzYUs0q3OCuMBuBRQm_J9PXgzas6KPRGe6o7g-sobSxaGZNukvNES8pwio\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>At the Byebug Prompt<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now type into the server console session, and you can do anything you could do from the rails console, plus byebug commands.&nbsp; In particular, you can look at the value of variables.&nbsp; Type this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>params<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And it will show you the value of the parameters passed to the controller.&nbsp; In particular, it will show \u201cid\u201d=&gt;\u201d567\u201d.&nbsp; Now type:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Customer.all<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and it will show you a list of the customer records you created.  None of them have id 567, so that is the reason for the error. Type c and hit enter.&nbsp; This will allow the server to continue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comments on Byebug<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very short introduction to byebug.&nbsp; In practice, if you are developing a real application, you will have bugs.&nbsp; To fix them, you will use byebug a lot!&nbsp; It\u2019s a good idea to practice with it, by putting byebug statements at various points in the code and experimenting with what you can see.&nbsp; There are byebug cheatsheets on the web.&nbsp; You can even put byebug statements in your erb files, by adding this line:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;% byebug %&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a good idea to learn more about byebug than is described in this short lesson.  Here is a tutorial: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sitepoint.com\/the-ins-and-outs-of-debugging-ruby-with-byebug\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.sitepoint.com\/the-ins-and-outs-of-debugging-ruby-with-byebug\/<\/a> This is not a required part of the assignment, but it may help you learn byebug.  (Note: this tutorial has a sample project you can clone, but because it has old packages you will have to do a bundle update to get it to run.)  Another good tutorial on byebug is here: <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/le-wagon-tokyo\/debugging-with-byebug-gem-6a47b2a210bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/medium.com\/le-wagon-tokyo\/debugging-with-byebug-gem-6a47b2a210bb <\/a>.  You should now be familiar with the following command line tools: irb, which is the ruby interactive runtime; and bin\/rails console, which is the rails console.  Everything you can do from the rails console is can also be done in a byebug session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to take all byebug statements out of the code before you push it to production!  If the server does hit a byebug statement it will hang at that point.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Getting Started with a Customer App We will start the quick way.&nbsp; While in your Backend-validations directory, type: Then, edit your config\/routes.rb.&nbsp; You are probably tired of seeing the Yay!
