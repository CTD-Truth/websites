This practicum will give students the experience  of <strong>working with a team to build a real app,<\/strong> essential skills to become a software developer. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are five components to Code the Dream classes: Instructional materials, Assignments, Mentor sessions, Community, and Final projects.  Each week you  have responsibilities in each of these areas (though you don&#8217;t have to think about final projects until the second half of the class). This list takes you through each component of the class and gives you a guide for what to do each week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the suggestions below each week as a kind of checklist for what you need to do, but success in CTD classes is more than just checking some boxes.  Each component is designed to help make you a great programmer and ultimately help prepare you for a great job as a software developer.  This isn&#8217;t a school class where you are graded on each individual video you have watched or not watched, it&#8217;s about helping you build a foundation of understanding programming and development. However, if you dedicate sufficient time to each of the class components, we do believe you can be successful. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MASCOF CHECKLIST<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___ (M) Instructional Materials<\/li><li>___ (A) Assignments<\/li><li>___ (S) Mentor Sessions<\/li><li>___ (CO) Community<\/li><li>___ (F) Final projects<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color:#ff5c35\" class=\"has-inline-color\">M: Instructional Materials &amp; Videos<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Code the Dream partners with Treehouse to provide video instruction. CTD will provide every student with a Treehouse account, and will be able to review each student\u2019s progress on Treehouse. There may also be additional articles and tutorials that you are assigned to read.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___ <strong>Watch<\/strong> all assigned videos, and read any additional articles or materials provided. The videos may take several hours to get through.<\/li><li>___<strong>Code<\/strong> alongside the videos in your code editor (or in Treehouse Workspaces).<\/li><li>___<strong>Take notes<\/strong> that you can access later (Google docs are great, because you can search by term, unlike pen and paper, but paper might be easier to write on as you are watching and coding).<\/li><li>___<strong>Make a list of questions<\/strong> you have about the material; highlight them so you can find them easily later. These are questions you can ask in the mentor sessions, or post in Slack.<\/li><li>___<strong>Consider<\/strong>: When you finish the videos (and\/or articles), what is your understanding of the key learning concepts? How would you explain it to someone else? What parts do you need help understanding?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color:#ff5c35\" class=\"has-inline-color\">A: Assignments<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You will have coding assignments each each, most of which will be submitted through Github.  This is probably the most important aspect of the week&#8217;s tasks. The following applies to the majority of CTD lessons, though not all. Make sure you are following the instructions for your week\u2019s lesson.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___<strong>Read<\/strong> through all assignment instructions.<\/li><li>___<strong>Work<\/strong> through your assignment in your code editor (or other designated space).<\/li><li>___<strong>Ask<\/strong> students and mentors for help if you get stuck, as well as reviewing your notes, the videos, and googling.<\/li><li>___<strong>Make a list of questions<\/strong> you have about the assignment; highlight them so you can find them easily later. These are questions you can ask in the mentor sessions, or post in Slack.<\/li><li>___<strong>Doublecheck<\/strong>.

Once the Slackbot form pops up, fill it out accordingly and submit!<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>___<strong>Submit a link EVEN if your code is not running correctly.<\/strong> Your Squibby submission is the only way we know you have worked on your assignment.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>___<strong>Be patient with reviewers<\/strong>. All of our assignment reviewers are volunteers and it might take a long time for your assignment to be reviewed- and there are times when it might not get reviewed at all. That&#8217;s why it is so important for you to double check on your own that your code runs. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color:#ff5c35\" class=\"has-inline-color\">S: Mentor Sessions<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mentor sessions are small group meetings with a professional developer (or CTD Apprentice) to review the lessons and assignments for the week. Students must attend at least two mentor sessions each week; you can attend more if you want, as long as the session isn\u2019t over-crowded. If you attend mentor sessions at the beginning of the week, the mentors know you won\u2019t have finished the material.<\/em>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___<strong>Sign up<\/strong> at the beginning of the week for the mentor sessions you plan to attend that week.<\/li><li>___<strong>Attend<\/strong> your mentor sessions. The mentors do take attendance. If you cannot come, let the mentor know, and sign up for a different session instead.<\/li><li>___<strong>Prepare<\/strong> in advance for your mentor sessions; you can even share your questions with the mentor ahead of time. Share your progress in terms of the videos and the assignment.<\/li><li>___<strong>Catch up<\/strong> with catch-up mentor sessions if you need to, but still come to the regular week\u2019s sessions, even if you are behind. Just let the mentor know ahead of time.<\/li><li>___<strong>Thank your mentors! <\/strong>They are all volunteers who really want to help you learn, but they are also busy professionals! Some mentors are able to offer one-on-one meetings outside of mentor sessions and others are not.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color:#ff5c35\" class=\"has-inline-color\">C: Community<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>An important element of a learning environment is a supportive community where you can ask questions and explore. All Code the Dream classes have active Slack channels. Some classes have also created their own Discord channels to continue the conversation. While you aren\u2019t allowed to copy each other\u2019s code, we definitely encourage helping each other. Make the most of the opportunity to learn alongside others!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___<strong>Post<\/strong> your questions in the Slack channel. If you have a question, most likely someone else does too! &nbsp;Mentors and some CTD Apprentices are also in the Slack channel and can help answer questions.<\/li><li>___<strong>Respond<\/strong> to questions others have asked, if you can, and\/or share your own experiences with the issues asked about. We can all learn from each other and can all pitch in.<\/li><li>___<strong>Request<\/strong> a one-on-one session with a mentor to work on specific questions that need more time<\/li><li>___<strong>Schedule<\/strong> video chats and study sessions with classmates if it is helpful for you to work together with others.<\/li><li>___<strong>Help each other! <\/strong>We are in this together, and part of Code the Dream&#8217;s philosophy is about giving back. Students are on different levels. If you have more experience, please help people who are newer to coding.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span style=\"color:#ff5c35\" class=\"has-inline-color\">F: Final Project<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For the front-end and back-end classes, the final project is perhaps the most critical aspect of assessing your overall comprehension in the class and will, in large-part, contribute to whether or not you move on to the next level or apprenticeship.<\/em>  <em>The Intro to Programming final project is different. Rather than a new, stand-alone app, it is a culmination of what you have built on in the class and will be something you can add to your portfolio.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>___<strong>Envision<\/strong>: During the first couple months of class, start to envision practical examples of how to apply the skills you are learning. Start to think of what kinds of projects you might like to create.<\/li><li>___<strong>Check the Rubric. <\/strong>Make sure you look at the requirements for the final project <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/final-projects-rubric\/\">here<\/a>. <\/li><li>___<strong>Outline<\/strong>: About 10 weeks into the class, you will get the final-project proposal form, in which you outline the app you intend to build for your final project.<\/li><li>___<strong>Work<\/strong>: Most class instruction ends between 13-14 weeks, and you have the remaining time to complete your project (week 16). During this time, you can request consultations with mentors for assistance.<\/li><li>___<strong>Present<\/strong>: At the end of class, you will present your final project by doing a short demo of your app in front of your classmates and mentors!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instructional Materials AssignmentsMentor SessionsCommunityFinal Project \/Practicum Update Aug. 2021: Please note that we are very likely adding on an important component to the Code the Dream student program that is not reflected in these materials: a required 8-week practicum after the course work and individual projects wrap up.
