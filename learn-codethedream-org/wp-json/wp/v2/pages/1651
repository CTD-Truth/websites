That section also covers arrays, which you will be learning next week, and Test Driven Development which will be covered later in this class.  You can use the link to preview the array and test driven development content this week if you like, but the main information you need for this week is in the following excerpt: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Loops<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers don\u2019t get tired, and they\u2019re really,&nbsp;<em>really<\/em>&nbsp;fast! For that reason, they are well suited to solving problems that involve doing calculations multiple times. In some cases, a computer will be able to repeat a task&nbsp;<em>thousands<\/em>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<em>millions<\/em>&nbsp;of times in just a few short seconds where it might take a human many hours. (Obviously, speed here depends on the complexity of the calculation and the speed of the computer itself). One way to make a computer do a repetitive task is using a&nbsp;<strong>loop<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Read this&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Learn\/JavaScript\/Building_blocks\/Looping_code\" target=\"_blank\">MDN article<\/a>. It\u2019s a longer one, but make sure you tackle the \u2018Active Learning\u2019 sections at the bottom of the page.<\/li><li>Once again, same info, slightly different context from&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/javascript.info\/while-for\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript.info<\/a>. (Skim the info if you think you know it all, but&nbsp;<strong>don\u2019t forget the tasks at the end of the page<\/strong>. You learn best by&nbsp;<em>doing<\/em>.)<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Assignments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Coding Assignment<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your assignment for this week can be found&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/replit.com\/@CodeTheDream\/Javascript-Functions-2-Loops#index.js\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/replit.com\/@CodeTheDream\/Javascript-Functions-2-Loops#index.js\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a>. When the link opens you will need to fork the repo (click the fork button). And then follow the instructions in the file created to do your assignment. You will then turn in your forked link once you have finished all of the questions in the assignment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mindset Assignment<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The field of software development is constantly growing and changing\u2014new programming languages, libraries, tools, and best practices are coming out all the time\u2014and what is possible in technology is fueled by the curiosity and open-mindedness of programmers to learn and experiment with new things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this week\u2019s mindset prompts we\u2019re going to focus on developing a practice of learning as a way to grow and evolve your technical skills. Here\u2019s a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/developertea.simplecast.com\/episodes\/habits-of-learning-developers\"><strong>brief episode of Developer Tea<\/strong><\/a> that we think gets to the core of good learning habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; In your own words, what does it mean to be curious about something?<br>&#8211; What\u2019s one thing that you were curious to learn more about recently (this doesn&#8217;t need to be coding-related)? How did you learn more about it?<br>&#8211; What&#8217;s one best practice you&#8217;ve learned in your first few weeks at CTD that you don&#8217;t know &#8220;the why&#8221; behind? How can you find out &#8220;the why&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Coding Assignment, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, submit ALL of your assignments (coding and mindset) using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Objectives Simplify Repetitive Tasks with Loops Working with &#8216;for&#8217; Loops Lesson Materials The following material is an excerpt from The Odin Project &#8211; Fundamentals Part 4.
