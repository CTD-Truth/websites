Web Basics I serves as an introduction to computer programming. You&#8217;ll start with Treehouse&#8217;s Digital Literacy track, which covers basic computing principles and introduces you to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, &amp; Git. By the time you finish your final project, you&#8217;ll have the foundations every programmer needs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a quick outline containing the class timeline followed by a Course Overview links to each Treehouse library course or CTD supplemental course. Remember to keep pace with the mentor groups, and don&#8217;t hesitate to ask lots of questions.
