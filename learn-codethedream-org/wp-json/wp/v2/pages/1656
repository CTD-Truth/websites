Next week you&#8217;ll learn about the newer\/best practice way of handling API calls.  We want you to learn this old way first because it helps demonstrate what an API is and how it works (how data is transferred to and from a client\/user and a server where data is stored).  Watch this video and read this tutorial to get an understanding of AJAX.  JSON is the common way data is returned from an API call.  This video will also talk about JSON and how to work with data in that format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Video:<\/strong> <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"JSON and AJAX Tutorial: With Real Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rJesac0_Ftw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tutorial:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/ajax-tutorial\/\">Free Code Camp &#8211; AJAX tutorial<\/a><br><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"assignments\"><strong>Assignments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coding Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week you will be learning how to fetch data via AJAX.

Feel free to review that topic and your answers this week (<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/how-the-web-works\/\">link to that week&#8217;s lesson here<\/a>). We&#8217;ll be talking about asking for help again, but this time let&#8217;s focus on the <em>when <\/em>since we&#8217;ve already covered the <em>how<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of this course you may have wanted to ask for help as soon as you hit a problem and before you even tried to debug or problem solve on your own. You don&#8217;t have to do that anymore since you have those problem solving and debugging processes we&#8217;ve been talking about. But the opposite can happen too; sometimes you get so determined to solve the problem on your own that you spend hours longer than you needed to trying to fix something, when asking for help could have saved you time and frustration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read this article about <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/04\/how-to-ask-for-help-at-work\">knowing when to ask for help at work<\/a><\/strong>, then answer the following questions:<br>&#8211; Have you implemented\/used any new strategies since the previous post on how to ask for help?
