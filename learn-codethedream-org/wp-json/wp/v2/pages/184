You will learn how to do that in the Treehouse videos and the assignment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you will be learning: The Terminal and Git &amp; GitHub<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using your terminal is the foundation of coding- it&#8217;s how you will interact with your coding environment. And getting to know GitHub is absolutely essential to becoming a strong developer. It\u2019s how you save your work and work collaboratively with others.  Professional software developers use GitHub every single day- and at Code the Dream we want you to start getting comfortable with it from day one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Complete the following Treehouse lessons.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following links are to the Treehouse tracks covered in Intro to Programming. Use the weekly assignments pages to find out which tracks you should finish each week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>1.1<\/strong> \u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/teamtreehouse.com\/library\/introduction-to-the-terminal\">Introduction to Terminal<\/a><\/strong> (112 min)<\/li><li><strong>1.2<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/teamtreehouse.com\/library\/introduction-to-git\">Introduction to Git<\/a> <\/strong>(186 min)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assignment <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your assignment for Lesson 1 is to set up your coding environment and push your first code repository to Github.

In the next section of Intro to Programming, you\u2019ll learn the basics of JavaScript, the most popular programming language. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s it for this week!
