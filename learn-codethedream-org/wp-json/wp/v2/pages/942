(Pro tip: Those also end up being the truly satisfying wins!) But have you ever looked at a new problem and thought \u201cI have no idea how to even get started!\u201d \u2026 Fear not! Problem solving is a learned skill too, and if you develop a solid process\u2014e.g., understanding the problem, planning, dividing the problem into subproblems\u2014even the trickiest of challenges can be chipped away at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>FreeCodeCamp article<\/strong><\/a> does a nice job of defining a problem solving process.
