The tests are written based on the specifications for the product and for the features that must be added.  By doing test first development, you can ensure that you have comprehensive automated testing and that the developed features match the defined specifications.  Once the tests are written, the actual code is written to make the test pass.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your assignment, the tests have been written. When you run the tests, they will fail until you write the code needed to make them pass, which is how you know that you have completed the assignment correctly.  For several of thenparts of the assignment, you have the opportunity to extend the provided tests so as to test additional features, and you should do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entry level development jobs often consist of the creation of automated tests, so being able to write them is a valuable skill.  We will write automated tests in the Rails section of this course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"assignments\">Assignments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your assignment for Lesson 2.3 can be found<a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/TEnB9osU\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Code-the-Dream-School\/Backend-ruby-testfirst\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a>.
