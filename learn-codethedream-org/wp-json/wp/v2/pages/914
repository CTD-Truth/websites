And this is one of the most fundamental mindsets to develop as a new software developer! (If you haven\u2019t heard of growth mindset, here&#8217;s a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU\"><strong>TED talk from Carol Dweck<\/strong><\/a>, who coined the term.)<br><br>But developing the right mindset to learn coding doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014we believe there are a number of important mindsets to develop. Each week, throughout this course, we\u2019ll be posting articles and discussion questions here to help give insight into mindsets that can support not only your learning but your long-term career growth as a software developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help us set the stage for our mindsets, we\u2019ll kick off by first thinking about our goals and motivations and reflecting on how growth mindset has impacted our past learning experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Why do you want to be a software developer?<br>&#8211; What do you plan to do with your skills after the class ends?<br>&#8211; Can you think of a time when a growth mindset helped you learn or achieve something new?<br>&#8211; What other mindsets have helped you learn new skills?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you&#8217;ve completed your Coding Assignment, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, submit ALL of your assignments (coding and mindset) using the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Objectives Create Reusable Code with Functions Pass Information Into Functions Arrow Functions Materials Complete the following Treehouse lessons: JavaScript Functions&nbsp;(128 min) Assignments Coding Assignment Your assignment for this week can be found\u00a0here.
