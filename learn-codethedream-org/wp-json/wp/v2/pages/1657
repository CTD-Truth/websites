And for that reason, as you\u2019re learning to code, you may find that your gut response to bright red error messages or long stack traces is one of fear, anger, or frustration. But we\u2019ll let you in on a little secret\u2014those error messages and stack traces are a gift. (And they\u2019re the key to learning!) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no faster way to learn than to experiment often. Try your code out incrementally as you work on it and see what is or is not working the way you expect! Then put your budding debugging skills to work and figure out what\u2019s going on. If you spend all of your time worrying about making your code perfect before running it, chances are you\u2019ve waited too long. If you don\u2019t believe us, here\u2019s a testimonial on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.codinghorror.com\/success-through-failure\/\"><strong>the power of learning from failure<\/strong><\/a> from one of the co-founders of Stack Overflow. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you encounter an error or failure is another time you have discovered what doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s valuable information! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Think of an example of something you have done in your life that you failed at multiple times before you got it\u2014doesn&#8217;t have to be coding-related, maybe a sports play, a piece on a musical instrument, or a video game level. How did you keep yourself motivated to keep trying? <br>&#8211; Have you witnessed others learn from failures and then succeed?
