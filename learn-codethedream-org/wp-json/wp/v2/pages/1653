When we\u2019re a beginner, we certainly don\u2019t know how everything works, and every new topic we stumble across uncovers new and sometimes more complex questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Independently searching for answers on Google, Youtube, and Stack Overflow and developing good debugging practices is a great start, but that may not solve all the challenges you come across (or certainly not in the most timely manner). So learning <em>when<\/em> and <em>how<\/em> to ask for help is a skill we recommend developing in this course. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of time may vary person-to-person, but explore what rule of thumb works for you (e.g., \u201cIf I\u2019ve been working at a problem for &gt; 20min and haven\u2019t uncovered any new information or don\u2019t have anything to try next, time to stop and ask!\u201d) Once you\u2019ve made the decision to ask, then it&#8217;s important to consider the appropriate level of detail and context to include in the question and who to ask. (Just posting \u201cHELPP!!\u201d in the group Slack channel doesn\u2019t give people much to go off of.) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/how-to-ask-good-technical-questions\/\"><strong>this article<\/strong><\/a> to get some inspiration for how to ask good technical questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; What\u2019s your rule of thumb for when to ask for help? <br>&#8211; When is an instance where you wish you would have asked for help sooner? <br>&#8211; What information have you found crucial to include in your questions so that mentors or peers can help answer your questions quicker?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Coding Assignment, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, submit ALL of your assignments (coding and mindset) using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Objectives How the Web Works URLs Domain Names IP addresses The Domain Name System HTTP and HTTPS Materials Go to each link in this list and read through the content on that page.
