Put answers to the following questions in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?<\/li><li>Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and and error message are send back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist.  Assume that you&#8217;ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class.  Complete the code:<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    const {id: taskID} = req.params\n    const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID })\n    if (!task){\n       \n    }\n    res.status(200).json({ task })\n})<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As you will see in the lessons that follow, you do not have to create the asyncWrapper middleware, because you can instead use an NPM package called express-async-errors that provides the capability.  The course uses Express 4, but in Express 5, function equivalent to express-async-errors is automatically included, so for Express 5 this package is not needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mindset Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mindset assignment for this week can be found here: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/mindset-curriculum-debugging-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Debugging<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"submitting-your-work\"><strong>Submitting Your Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are done, do the following, use the same procedure as for previous lessons.
