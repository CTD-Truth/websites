None of us know what tomorrow may bring. The interesting thing about that fear is that it can be positive or negative. If you\u2019ve been excited about the prospect of starting a new job, starting a new relationship, or venturing to a new place, you\u2019re experiencing the positive side. If you\u2019re worried about something in the future that may be an unpleasant experience like having to confront someone about a problem or ending a personal or professional relationship, you\u2019re experiencing the negative side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be feeling this way in this class; excited to learn new things and start a new chapter in your life, frustrated if you struggle with a concept, happy when you understand and succeed, worried about how to juggle class with the rest of what is going on in your life. Whether your fear of the unknown is positive or negative,<strong>&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/finnhvman\/embrace-the-unknown-35an\" target=\"_blank\">read this article about embracing the unknown<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong>and how it allows you to continue on your journey and see where it goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe expert in anything was once a beginner\u201d<br>\u2014 Helen Hayes<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week think about where you\u2019re at in your journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please answer the below prompts in your assignment submission:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>So far in class, have you had any \u201caha\u201d moments?
