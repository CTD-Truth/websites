Visual hierarchy is how we decide where to place pieces of our site so they&#8217;ll be easy to find, interact with, or stand out. Have you ever been somewhere (in person or on the web) that was new to you and you needed a minute to find your way around? If it was a physical location, how did you find the exits\/bathrooms\/stairs? If it was a website, were you able to find the page that had the information you wanted easily, like the product description page? Visual hierarchy goes a long way in whether or not the user has an easy and pleasant experience navigating their environment, or a challenging and frustrating time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/xd.adobe.com\/ideas\/process\/information-architecture\/visual-hierarchy-principles-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\">This article from Adobe<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0is a lengthy one, but covers basically all the variables to take into account when creating a layout.
