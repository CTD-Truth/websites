Your Postman configuration should have globals for the URL and, as the instructor explains, the accessToken.  You improve the error handling to return meaningful error messages to the user when Mongoose validation errors occur.  You then add security protection for the application so that it can be deployed on Heroku.  The security configuration uses the following node packages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>helmet<\/li><li>cors<\/li><li>xss-clean<\/li><li>express-rate-limit<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These packages must be used whenever you deploy an application publicly, to minimize the chance of a security exposure.  For your class final project, you will use these same packages, because you will deploy your final project on Heroku, and you want it to be secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for previous lessons, you duplicate the work that the instructor shows.  You continue to put your work in the new 06-jobs-api repository. If you get stuck, answers are in the node-express-course\/06-jobs-api\/final directory, but please try to do your own work. Before you start this lesson, you create the week10 git branch, which should be created when the week9 git branch is active. This lesson runs from 8:20:55 to 9:34:54 of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/qwfE7fSVaZM?t=30048\">this video<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Assignments<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coding Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be sure you test each step with Postman, creating a Postman collection of tests just like the instructor is doing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deploy to Heroku, you must create a free Heroku account if you don&#8217;t have one.  The instructor explains how to do this.  You also install the Heroku CLI on your machine.  The instructor then copies the 06-jobs-api\/final directory to the desktop, but you should copy the 06-jobs-api\/starter directory, as this is the one that contains your code.  Then, making the adjustments that the instructor shows, you push the application to Heroku.  You will find that there are a number of jobs-api applications on Heroku already, so you have to choose a name for your application that doesn&#8217;t conflict, like jobs-api-478 or some other number.  You then set the configuration variables from your .env file into the Heroku configuration for the application.  Then you test the production application using Postman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The section of the video from 9:34:54 to the end discusses setting up a Swagger configuration.  When you have an API, you need to document it so that implementers of applications that call the API know what the operations are.  Swagger is the best way to do that.  It also creates a graphical user interface so that one can call the APIs directly from the UI.  You should watch this section so that you understand how a Swagger configuration may be created and what functions it provides.  However, this section of the video is complicated and confusing, so unless you are very brave, you probably don&#8217;t want to try to implement Swagger for your application. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mindset Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mindset assignment for this week can be found here: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/mindset-curriculum-problem-solving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Problem Solving<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"submitting-your-work\"><strong>Submitting Your Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are done, do the following, use the same procedure as for previous lessons.
