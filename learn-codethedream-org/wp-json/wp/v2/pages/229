Beyond that, because of the importance of javaScript fundamentals (loops, arrays, conditionals, objects, and functions) we want to provide some additional reading material outside of Treehouse that students should read this week. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, I encourage all the students to talk on Slack a lot this week and really help each other out with regards to how to organize your game logic and your code. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 600;\"><strong>3.0 javaScript reading materials<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"airtable-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/embed\/shrxLUIo0ZCDmCQLo?backgroundColor=blue&amp;viewControls=on\" frameborder=\"0\" onmousewheel=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"533\" style=\"background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;\"><\/iframe>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 600;\"><strong><br><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Assignment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.github.com\/a\/U3MfyvQF\">Here<\/a> is the link to your assignment <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the third week of Web Basics II.
