In this lesson, you are asked to enhance the blog application with a new model for order objects that has a belongs_to association with customer objects.  The specifications for your assignment are in the slides. You will add the routes for CRUD operations on Active Record instances of this model.  You will add a controller to process the CRUD web requests.  You will add views and partials to list, show, create, and update order records.  You will add rspec tests to check that your code works as expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The assignment is described in these slides: <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=14SYpYdjz9y5gu31fAdwGXtG7wID0arjAxI0_csv7WG4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Full Assignm (opens in a new tab)\">Full Assignm<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=14SYpYdjz9y5gu31fAdwGXtG7wID0arjAxI0_csv7WG4\">ent<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the concepts required to complete the assignment have been presented up to now, with a couple of small exceptions explained in the slides.  The idea is to verify that you can use these concepts more or less on your own, but it&#8217;s not a test so people can work together.  And, of course, ask any questions you have via slack or in your sessions with mentors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please remember to push your work to github.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the lessons up to now, you have learned about routes, resources, models, views, controllers, and Active Record associations.
