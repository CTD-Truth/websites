The age old myth of the lone coder sitting in the dark coding through the night has finally been upended in recent years. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading tech industry companies now create open, collaborative workspaces and harness tools that enable software developers to work together more effectively\u2014if not on code directly then at least on knowledge sharing or getting projects over the finish line. Especially given your cohort mates in Code the Dream are working toward similar goals, there&#8217;s no time like the present to start putting peer-to-peer collaboration into practice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2020\/04\/collaborative-coding-ultimate-career-hack\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>This article<\/strong><\/a> shares some more formal methods of collaboration common in the software development space (including pair programming, code reviewing, and agile), but feel free to start with some lighter weight collaboration practices first, like asking a peer to hop on a screenshare to walk through code with you when you get stuck\u2014and offering to do the same for them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please answer the below prompts in your assignment submission:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>How is collaboration used in your own family\/culture\/current workplace\/etc.?<\/li><li>What\u2019s one challenge you, personally, encounter while collaborating with others?
