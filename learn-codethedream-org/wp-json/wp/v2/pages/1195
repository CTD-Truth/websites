If team member(s) are unavailable to attend, the team should plan to either cover a person&#8217;s contribution in the presentation or make a recording of your presentation in which all team members participate (to then be shared during Weekly Cafe).   <em>At least one team member MUST attend the Weekly Cafe presentations. <\/em> This week you can begin thinking\/planning\/organizing your presentation.
