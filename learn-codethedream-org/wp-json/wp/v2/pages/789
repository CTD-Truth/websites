You will do additional Ruby coding in lesson 2.3.  However, we have covered all of the elements.  It is not easy to learn an entire language this fast, but we need to continue so that we can adequately cover Rails.  Please review this cheatsheet for Ruby, and make sure that you understand each of the elements of the cheatsheet: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ThibaultJanBeyer\/cheatsheets\/blob\/master\/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md\" target=\"_blank\">Cheatsheet.<\/a>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often you will need to refer to the classes and methods of the Ruby standard library.  You can find a complete reference using Google.  For example, suppose you need to understand the methods of the DateTime class.  You can do a google search on ruby datetime and it will show you a reference.   Here is a complete reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/ruby-doc.org\/stdlib-3.0.2\/\">https:\/\/ruby-doc.org\/stdlib-3.0.2\/<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rails expands the standard library.
