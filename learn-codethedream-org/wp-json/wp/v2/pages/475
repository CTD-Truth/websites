You will have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and creativity. You are required to create a React application from scratch. A proposal for what your application will do is required to be submitted before you start working on the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code the Dream primarily develops applications that help organizations deliver services to the community, or contribute toward social good in other ways. You can see descriptions of some of the applications now in production here: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codethedream.org\/portfolio\/\">https:\/\/www.codethedream.org\/portfolio\/<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your final project, ideas for applications that could contribute in this way are strongly encouraged.&nbsp; The COVID-19 virus creates some new needs that may inspire you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, don\u2019t let this limit you. Other types of applications will also be considered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please don&#8217;t think you have to match any of the applications in the Code The Dream portfolio.  Those applications are many person months of hard work.   You just have to demonstrate some key skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YP5vw5yBGYU&amp;ab_channel=CodetheDream_Reid\" target=\"_blank\">this video of presentations of final projects<\/a> by previous Ruby on Rails students to give you some ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Before You Start<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please discuss your proposal with us.&nbsp; You will fill out a form to describe your proposal, saying what you would like to do.&nbsp; We will evaluate the proposal to make sure:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>That it is doable in the allotted time.&nbsp; If the project seems too complicated, we may suggest that it be limited to just a few features.<\/li><li>That it demonstrates the skills you have learned in the class series so far.&nbsp; It should not be so simple that it doesn\u2019t show key skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>That it gives you an opportunity to demonstrate creativity, which is important for a developer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find that you want to use some concepts, technologies, or gems we didn\u2019t cover, which is worth some extra points so long as it doesn\u2019t get too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Requirements for the Project (Rubric)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A React Application using create-react-app <\/li><li>Using Firebase as your database\/api layer<\/li><li>Application must have at least two data models that have CRUD functionality (add, edit, delete, view, one of them should be users with additional meta data added to the user object)<\/li><li>Using a variety of data types: integer, string, boolean, object<\/li><li>Wireframes that express functionality of application and how a user flows through the app.<\/li><li>Routing and at least one route using :params<\/li><li>Authentication&nbsp;<\/li><li>Form controls should include several types of input fields.&nbsp; You might use text fields, drop-down lists, checkboxes, radio buttons, and\/or others, and there should be some links to connect the application together.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Error handling (for authentication, and any other places where applicable)<\/li><li>API keys should not be exposed in the code or on github (use a .env file)<\/li><li>Application code stored in GITHUB<\/li><li>Links or buttons to help the users navigate to different views\/containers within the application.<\/li><li>Style your application by adding CSS, the use of bootstrap is highly recommended<\/li><li>The application should be attractive with inclusion of images, color, fonts and other css styling.<\/li><li>Application should be responsive and\/or mobile friendly<\/li><li>If you are using an external API, check in with us to make sure we approve<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Submission<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should submit a link to your Github repository which contains your application. It is highly encouraged that you use git branches to implement each feature.  We will share a link to a form before the due-date which you can use to submit your link. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Presentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each student will present their application in a Zoom meeting.&nbsp; You will only have 5 minutes for each presentation, but we will have reviewed your application with you ahead of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(prior to Dec 2021) Developing Your Own React.js Application For the final project, you will each design and develop your own React application.&nbsp; You will have two weeks to complete the project.&nbsp; As that is a short time for a fully functional application, the applications will have to be relatively simple, with only a few<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":"","_vp_format_video_url":"","_vp_image_focal_point":[]},"featured_image_src":null,"featured_image_src_square":null,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/475"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=475"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/475\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=475"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
