Perhaps there was an area that was hard to click, colors are hard on their eyes, or maybe something breaks when they&#8217;re using the Leave a Message section, for example.  Getting user feedback can help you decide where you want or need to make adjustments to your site before submitting your completed work.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also be sure to attend your mentor sessions this week to get similar feedback on your site&#8217;s functionality, appearance, accessibility, and responsiveness.  You are welcome to practice your final project presentation (<strong><a href=\"#Final-Project-Presentation\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#Final-Project-Presentation\">more information below<\/a><\/strong>) during your mentor sessions, if there aren&#8217;t students in your session who need assistance with their code.  If you would like to practice your presentation, you can always get on a call with classmates and take turns practicing\/sharing as well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mindset Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to your final week!  This week we&#8217;ll be talking about accessibility. Take a moment and think of a time when there was something you wanted or needed but didn&#8217;t have access to it for some reason or another. Being denied access to something you want or need can feel beyond frustrating.<br>The internet is a very powerful tool. So many businesses give extra discounts to people with accounts on their sites; government offices keep forms on their sites now instead of keeping paper copies; medical offices now use client portals for people to be able to access and pay their accounts, and schedule appointments and services. Not being able to get around and use any of these sites can make something that was supposed to be a better\/easier alternative seem like a huge stumbling block.<br><br>Accessibility focuses on making sure that those of us who are helping build these structures build them in a way that EVERYONE can use them easily. Read the information at the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/intro\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>WebAim site<\/strong><\/a> then check out the <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.a11yproject.com\/checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\">A11y Checklist<\/a><\/strong>.  These should give you an introduction into the challenges some people face when trying to use and interact with websites, and the ways in which we can assure our web creations are accessible to everyone.  We strongly recommend bookmarking a tool you can run your code through to help check for accessibility compliance (<a href=\"https:\/\/wave.webaim.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wave from WebAIM<\/a>) or a simple tool you can add to your code to help you check accessibility features on your site (like <a href=\"https:\/\/khan.github.io\/tota11y\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">totA11y from Khan Academy<\/a>).<br><br>Accessibility is a way bigger topic than we can cover here, but hopefully this starts your wheels turning about how to be sure that the awesome things you build throughout your career can be easily used by everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; When you&#8217;ve had limited or no access to something, what did you do? Were you ultimately able to get <br>   what you needed? If not, how did your lack of access impact your life? <br>&#8211; Now that you&#8217;ve read about accessibility, and hopefully considered some of the challenges others face <br>   using the internet, are there things you can\/will do differently in your current\/future project(s)? Give <br>   examples\/specifics.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Final Project, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, you will submit <span style=\"color: #ff5c35;\">TWO<\/span> forms this week. <\/strong><br><strong>Submit YOUR MINDSET work using the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a>.<\/strong> Please put &#8220;Final Project week&#8221; in the Link to Assignment field.<br><strong>SUBMIT YOUR FINAL PROJECT using the <a href=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/shrvDsCdQ24i80Lv2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION FORM<\/a>. <\/strong>It is important to use this form and complete it entirely as it will let us know what class you want to take next!<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"Final-Project-Presentation\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_329624-5b wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\" data-kb-block=\"kb-adv-heading_329624-5b\"><strong>Final Project Presentation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In web development, you may be asked to demonstrate how your work functions for a client, team member, or employer.  We want you to get a small taste of that experience now by presenting your final project to your peers, some of your mentors, and the class coordinator.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PRESENT THEIR FINAL PROJECT.<\/strong>  Exceptions will only be provided under certain circumstances.  There already has been, or soon will be, a final project presentation sign up sheet posted in your class&#8217; Slack channel.  <strong>If you have not signed up for a presentation night, please check your class&#8217; Slack channel and do so now.  <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>During the presentation night<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presentations will be held on the same Zoom link you have been using for mentor sessions throughout the course.  All participants are encouraged to have their videos on if they are able, and everyone but the speaker should have their sound muted.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will ask students to present in the order in which they are signed up on that sheet, so if your name is at the top of the list, expect to go first. Students only have to attend the night they are presenting, but are encouraged to attend any\/all presentation nights they are able, to show support for their classmates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each student will have a maximum of 3 minutes to present their work, and then we will allow participants to ask questions, or provide praise or helpful feedback for a minute after the presentation is complete.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>During your presentation<\/strong><br><br>Share your screen so we can see your final project in your browser.

During this time we will ask you to complete a post-class survey about your experience throughout the class.  Please answer fully and honestly.  Your answers will NEVER impact whether or not you advance to the next class, they are ONLY intended for Code the Dream to determine how we can improve our classes.  Once you&#8217;ve completed the survey (which will be emailed to you the last week of class or shortly after the end of class) AND your final project has been reviewed, we will send your certificate of completion to you by email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THANK YOU!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve enjoyed having you a part of this class, and a part of the Code the Dream family!
