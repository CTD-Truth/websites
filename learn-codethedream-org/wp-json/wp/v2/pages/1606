As the instructor creates node programs, you duplicate his work.

That page describes how to get git, the VSCode Editor, Node, and Postman.  All of those should be installed when you start this lesson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to do a git fork of your starter repository for this lesson, which is found <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Code-the-Dream-School\/node-express-course\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><\/strong>.  The fork button is on the upper right of that page.  Once the fork is complete, you clone your fork.  Please don&#8217;t clone the original repository, as if you do that, you will not be able to push your work to github.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do all of your work inside the directory created by the git clone, which is node-express-course.  Change directories so that you are inside that directory.  Then create the branch for this week, using the command<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git checkout -b week1<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now change the directory to the one that says 01-node-tutorial.  Then do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>mkdir answers\ncp -r content answers<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p> to create an answers directory within the node-express-course\/01-node-tutorial directory, and to create also the content directory and files within it  The answers directory is where you put your work for this part of the lesson.  As you do, you create a number of small programs.  Be sure to put them inside the answers directory.  The programs you create for this lesson are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>01-intro.js<\/li><li>02-globals.js<\/li><li>03-modules.js<\/li><li>04-names.js<\/li><li>05-utils.js<\/li><li>06-alternative-flavor.js<\/li><li>07-mind-grenade.js<\/li><li>08-os-module.js<\/li><li>09-path-module.js<\/li><li>10-fs-sync.js<\/li><li>11-fs-async.js<\/li><li>12-http.js<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These programs are also in the node-express-course\/01-node-tutorial directory, so you can check the answers if you get stuck &#8212; but this first lesson is easy, so you shouldn&#8217;t get stuck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mindset Assignment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No Mindset Assignment for your first week!  Just get comfortable finding your way around the class page, github, etc.  Don&#8217;t forget to reach out to mentors\/classmates\/Class Coordinator if you need help getting settled in this week!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"submitting-your-work\"><strong>Submitting Your Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are done, do the following to submit your work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git add -A\ngit commit -m \"answers for lesson 1\"\ngit push origin week1<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then go to your github repository &#8212; the one you created with a fork.  Create a pull request.  The target of the pull request should be the main branch of the repository you created.  Once you have created the pull request, you submit your link to the pull request using the submission form link in the next paragraph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Coding Assignment (reminder there is no Mindset Assignment this week) submit all of your work using the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/squibby2\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Materials You watch the first 1:45:57 of this video.
