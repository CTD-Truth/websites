Thank you for all your hard work thus far!  There is one more assignment, which is for a final project in Rails.  You may choose the project you work on, but it should match the rubric which is linked below.  Before you begin, please review your plan with class instructors, as described in the class slack channel.  They will consider whether it is doable in the time frame, and whether your plan can meet rubric requirements.  You will have three weeks to complete this project, and at the end of this period, at a time to be announced, you will present your project in a Zoom call.  Presentations are 5 minutes in length, and should show that you have met the requirements specified in the rubric.  Your final assignment code will also be reviewed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating Your Workspace<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no starter git repository for the final assignment.  You will first create a git repository on your github account.  The repository should be public.  It should also be empty, with no .gitignore or README.md file.  You create a new repository using the plus sign in the upper right of the github page, and you typically give the repository the same name as the application.  Then, from your laptop command line, you do<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>rails new &lt;application_name&gt;\ncd &lt;application_name&gt;\ngit init\ngit remote add origin &lt;your_repository_url&gt;\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit push -u origin master<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions about this procedure, ask them via the Slack channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you work on your application, you should create a feature branch for each new feature you add.  When you complete the feature and it is working, you will add and commit all changes and then push the feature branch to your github.  Then you will create a pull request on github.  Then you will merge your own pull request into the main branch.  You do this so that if you break something, you can go back to a previous state.  Be sure to commit and push frequently so that you don&#8217;t lose your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rubric<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your rubric for the final project is <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.codethedream.org\/back-end-2-final-project\/\">here.<\/a><\/strong>  Please study this closely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to the final lesson of the Ruby on Rails Back End Class.
