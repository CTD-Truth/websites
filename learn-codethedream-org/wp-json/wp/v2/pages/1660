Designing a website can be an intimidating task; so many colors and fonts and icons and graphics!  When it comes to designing the structure (home page, about page, etc.) and how you link JS, HTML, CSS, and other files there are clear rules or at least guidelines in order for the site to be functional. But when it comes to picking a color and font for the site anything goes, right? While you do have a lot more creative freedom (which is fun for some and terrifying for others) when it comes to the look of your site, there are still useful guidelines to keep in mind. After all, we hope that more than just you and your team and the client you&#8217;re building for will be viewing and using your site!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.webspec.com\/2017\/03\/the-importance-of-color-in-web-design\/\" target=\"_blank\">This article from WebSpecDesign<\/a><\/strong> gives a good introduction to beginners about color theory and usage on the web. In almost any resource about color theory on the web you&#8217;ll notice references to accessibility. We&#8217;ll dig more deeply into accessibility the last week of class, but since you&#8217;ll be choosing colors and fonts this week, please be sure to use the tool in the second question below by entering your font color as the &#8220;foreground color&#8221; and your page\/background color as the &#8220;background color&#8221; when making some of your creative decisions this week while working with CSS.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; What was something new you learned about colors\/color theory and how do you think that knowledge will effect your design choices?<br>&#8211; Try out some different background\/foreground color combinations <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/color.a11y.com\" target=\"_blank\">using this tool from A11y<\/a><\/strong>.
