If you did work with a mentor to figure out that bug, you likely observed them put a few debugging practices into action. Debugging is the process of working through technical challenges when something is broken or not working as expected, and it is a HUGE part of most developer\u2019s day-to-day. Ideally, we would write beautiful, perfect code the first time around and introduce no bugs\u2026 but we\u2019re human after all, so that\u2019s not the reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given, we humans do (often) introduce bugs into our programs, it&#8217;s important to invest time into strengthening your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rithmschool.com\/blog\/debugging-like-a-scientist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <strong>debugging processes<\/strong><\/a>\u2014coming up with hypotheses, observing and investigating how things are working, and piecing together the clues to figure out what\u2019s going on.
