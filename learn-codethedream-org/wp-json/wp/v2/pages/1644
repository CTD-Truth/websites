Felt like, \u201csomeone is going to find out that I don\u2019t deserve to be where I am\u201d or that \u201cothers know everything, and I know very little\u201d. Initially coined in the \u201870s, this phenomenon has a name\u2014Imposter Syndrome\u2014and though it tends to disproportionately affect those in underrepresented groups in tech, it is quite widespread across the industry. (A <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/why-58-of-tech-employees-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome\/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 study<\/a> <\/strong>reported that 58% of all tech workers feel this way!) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s not something that we can make magically go away\u2014in fact a lot of folks may feel it many years into their career. On a good note, however, it is something we can manage and harness in a positive way for growth and learning, as discussed in this <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zNBmHXS3A6I\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TED talk<\/strong><\/a> by Mike Cannon-Brookes, who founded and runs the tech behemoth, Atlassian. (Yes, even CEOs can have Imposter Syndrome!) And If you don\u2019t experience this phenomenon personally, it&#8217;s still worth understanding so you can keep an eye out for it in friends and peers and help them manage it. A good first start to managing Imposter Syndrome is to shine a light on it.  Talk to your classmates, mentors, friends, about your feelings and how to keep that self-doubt in check. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Have you every felt Imposter Syndrome yourself and, if you&#8217;re comfortable sharing, how did it manifest itself? What, if anything, has helped you mitigate these feelings? <br>&#8211; What do you think are some of the immediate or long-term effects of Imposter Syndrome if left unchecked?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you\u2019ve completed your Coding Assignment, and have read and thought about the mindset questions above, submit ALL of your assignments (coding and mindset) using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/asteroid-assignment-form\" target=\"_blank\">Squibby 2.0 Assignment Submission Form<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning Objectives What is the Fetch API?
