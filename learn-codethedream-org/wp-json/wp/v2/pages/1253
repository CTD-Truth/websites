Felt like, \u201csomeone is going to find out that I don\u2019t deserve to be where I am\u201d or that \u201cothers know everything, and I know very little\u201d. Initially coined in the \u201870s, this phenomenon has a name\u2014Imposter Syndrome\u2014and though it tends to disproportionately affect those in underrepresented groups in tech, it is quite widespread across the industry. (A&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/why-58-of-tech-employees-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome\/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 study<\/a>&nbsp;reported that 58% of all tech workers feel this way!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s not something that we can make magically go away\u2014in fact a lot of folks may feel it many years into their career. On a good note, however, it is something we can manage and harness in a positive way for growth and learning, as discussed in this&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zNBmHXS3A6I\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TED talk<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;by Mike Cannon-Brookes, who founded and runs the tech behemoth, Atlassian.
