<p>Welcome to Week 2 of Rails Development! In this unit, we will: </p>



<ul><li>Finish learning the basics of Ruby on Rails</li><li>Continue working in our blog application to learn about Rails scaffolding. </li></ul>



<h2>Practice: Ruby on Rails Basics</h2>



<p>In this Treehouse library class, you&#8217;ll keep learning about creating applications using Rails. Please note that this one is not part of the track, but you should do it anyway. </p>



<p>Complete the lesson here: <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-ruby-on-rails-basics">https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-ruby-on-rails-basics</a></p>



<h2>Rails Routes and Resources</h2>



<p>When you do the second one, you will be working in the blog application.  As the instructor does each step, be sure you pause the video and do the same step to your version of the application.  You should test as you go along, to make sure what you have done is working.  The instructor will show several different ways to do things.  The best approach is not to erase, but to comment out the first methods the instructor shows before inserting the subsequent approaches, so that you can remember each way to do things.  Be sure you push to github.</p>



<p>Complete the lesson here: <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/rails-routes-and-resources">https://teamtreehouse.com/library/rails-routes-and-resources</a></p>



<p>In summary, the assignments for week 2 are: </p>



<ol><li><strong>Complete <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/practice-ruby-on-rails-basics">Practice: Ruby on Rails Basics</a></strong></li><li><strong>Complete <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/rails-routes-and-resources">Rails Routes and Resources</a></strong></li></ol>
